## Product differentiation: overview

- **Horizontal v vertical differentiation**
  - **Horizontal**: consumers disagree on which variety is best
  - **Verticalunr**: products differ in quality; all consumers (weakly) prefer the higher-quality product at equal prices.

- What determines demand when prices are equal?
- How does variety interact with quantity?

- **Focus today: horizontal product differentiation**
  - Linear Hotelling model (two firms)
  - Salop's circular market (free entry)

## Linear Hotelling model: setting

- **Market structure**
  - Duopoly; zero marginal cost
  - Linear market of length $L$; consumers uniformly distributed
  - Each consumer buys either 1 unit or nothing

- **Preference parameters**
  - Firm 1 located at distance $a$ from left endpoint (0)
  - Firm 2 located at distance $b$ from right endpoint ($L$)
  - Linear transport cost: $C(d)=cd$ where $d$ is distance and $c>0$

- **Objects**
  - Choice variables: $p_1, p_2$
  - Parameters: $L, a, b, c$
  - Equilibrium outcomes: $x, y, q_1, q_2$

## Linear Hotelling: pricing with fixed locations (Firm 1)

- **Demand derivation**
  - Marginal consumer indifferent: $p_1 + cx = p_2 + cy$
  - Market length: $L = a + b + x + y$
  - Firm 1 demand: $q_1 = a + x = \frac{p_2 - p_1 + c(L + a - b)}{2c}$

- **Profit and best response**
  - $\pi_1 = p_1 q_1$
  - $BR_1(p_2)=\frac{p_2}{2}+\frac{c}{2}(L+a-b)$

::: {.callout-note}
## Interpretation (best response)

- $BR_1$ is increasing in $p_2$ (prices are strategic complements here)
- Larger $c$ softens competition, shifting best responses upward
:::

## Linear Hotelling: pricing with fixed locations (Firm 2)

- **Demand derivation**
  - Marginal consumer indifferent: $p_1 + cx = p_2 + cy$
  - Market length: $L = a + b + x + y$
  - Firm 2 demand: $q_2 = b + y = \frac{p_1 - p_2 + c(L + b - a)}{2c}$

- **Profit and best response**
  - $\pi_2 = p_2 q_2$
  - $BR_2(p_1)=\frac{p_1}{2}+\frac{c}{2}(L+b-a)$

::: {.callout-note}
## Interpretation (symmetry)

- If $a=b$, best responses are symmetric and yield $p_1^*=p_2^*$
:::

![](figs/fig-hotelling-fixed-location.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Linear Hotelling model: Nash equilibrium in prices

- **Best responses**
  - $BR_1(p_2) = \frac{p_2}{2} + \frac{c}{2}(L + a - b)$
  - $BR_2(p_1) = \frac{p_1}{2} + \frac{c}{2}(L + b - a)$

- **Nash equilibrium prices and profits**
  - $p_1^* = c\left(L + \frac{a-b}{3}\right)$; $p_2^* = c\left(L + \frac{b-a}{3}\right)$
  - $\pi_1^* = \frac{c}{18}(3L + a - b)^2$; $\pi_2^* = \frac{c}{18}(3L + b - a)^2$

::: {.callout-important}
## Key comparative static

Higher mismatch cost $c$ lowers substitutability and raises equilibrium markups and profits.
:::

## Linear Hotelling model: incentive to move (co-location)

- **If firms locate at the same point**
  - Then $a + b = L$ and the marginal consumer collapses to the location point: $x=y=0$
  - Products become homogeneous $\Rightarrow$ Bertrand undercutting
  - Unique equilibrium: $p_1^B=p_2^B=0$ and $\pi_1^B=\pi_2^B=0$

::: {.callout-warning}
## Co-location and price competition

Co-location removes captive consumers; any $p>0$ can be profitably undercut.
:::

![](figs/fig-hotelling-movement-location.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Linear Hotelling model: incentive to move (separated)

- **Marginal incentive to increase own location parameter**
  - $\frac{\partial \pi_1^*}{\partial a} = \frac{c}{9}(3L + a - b) > 0$
  - $\frac{\partial \pi_2^*}{\partial b} = \frac{c}{9}(3L + b - a) > 0$

- **Interpretation (pricing subgame only)**
  - Increasing $a$ (resp. $b$) moves Firm 1 (resp. Firm 2) inward (toward the centre)
  - These are comparative statics of equilibrium profits in the pricing subgame, holding the rival location fixed

## Linear Hotelling model: location equilibrium (linear v quadratic transport)

- **Result (standard)**
  - With linear transport costs ($C(d)=cd$), the full two-stage location game may fail to have a pure-strategy equilibrium in locations

- **Resolution**
  - d’Aspremont, Gabszewicz & Thisse (1979): with quadratic transport costs ($C(d)=td^2$), a pure-strategy location equilibrium exists (maximum differentiation in their baseline)

::: {.callout-note}
## Why convexity matters

More convex mismatch costs make small location changes less effective at stealing marginal consumers through pricing.
:::

## Linear Hotelling model: profit function

Profit function of Firm 1 (d'Aspremont, Gabszewicz & Thisse, 1979):

$$
\pi_1(p_1, p_2) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{p_1 p_2}{2c} - \frac{p_1^2}{2c} + \frac{(L+a-b)p_1}{2}
& \text{if } |p_1 - p_2| \le c(L - a - b) \\[0.5em]
Lp_1 & \text{if } p_1 < p_2 - c(L - a - b) \\[0.5em]
0 & \text{if } p_1 > p_2 + c(L - a - b)
\end{cases}
$$

- **Region 1 (interior)**: both firms serve positive mass of consumers; demand is linear in $p_1$
- **Region 2 (market capture)**: Firm 1 undercuts enough to serve the whole line segment
- **Region 3 (no demand)**: Firm 1 sets too high a price; demand is zero

- **Interpretation**
  - Kinks occur at the thresholds where a marginal consumer hits an endpoint of the market
  - Piecewise structure clarifies why global profit maximisation can differ from the interior FOC

## Salop's circular market: setting

- **Market structure**
  - Two sectors: one with homogeneous outside good; one with differentiated goods
  - Circular market circumference normalised to 1; consumers uniformly distributed
  - $n$ firms symmetrically located; distance between adjacent firms is $\frac{1}{n}$
  - Each consumer buys either one unit (from some firm) or the outside good

- **Objects**
  - Choice variable: $p_i$
  - Parameters: $n, c, u, u^*$
  - Outcomes: market boundary/location cutoffs, quantity per firm

![](figs/fig-salop-cycle.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Salop's circular market: consumer utility

::: {.callout-note}
## Participation constraint

Let $v=u-u^*$. A consumer participates in the differentiated sector iff $v \ge p_j + cd_j$.
:::

- **Preference heterogeneity**
  - Each consumer $i$ has ideal variety $\ell_i^*$ (location on the circle)
  - Linear transport (mismatch) cost: $cd$ where $d$ is arc distance

- **Utility from purchase**
  - Buy outside good: $U^O = u^*$
  - Buy from firm $j$: $U_j^D = u - c d_j - p_j$

- **Participation condition**
  - Consumer buys from firm $j$ iff $U_j^D \ge U^O$
  - Let $v = u - u^*$, so participation is $v \ge p_j + c d_j$

- **Interpretation**
  - $v$ is the net gross surplus from consuming a perfectly matched differentiated variety rather than the outside good
  - Transport costs convert “distance in product space” into a monetary disutility

## Salop's circular market: monopoly region (no competition)

- **Monopoly scenario**
  - Firm's market is truncated by the outside option (participation), not by neighbouring firms

- **Maximum distance**: $d_m = \frac{v - p}{c}$

- **Monopoly demand**: $q^M = 2 d_m = 2\left(\frac{v-p}{c}\right)$

- **Inverse demand**: $p = v - \frac{c}{2} q^M$

- **Interpretation**
  - Demand slope is $-\frac{c}{2}$ because increasing quantity expands the served interval on **both sides** of the firm
  - Participation binds at the marginal consumer: $v = p + cd_m$

## Salop's circular market: competitive region (with neighbors)

- **Competitive scenario**
  - Market boundary determined by indifference between this firm and neighbour(s)

- **Indifference condition**
  - Main firm: $v - cx - p$
  - Neighbour: $v - c\left(\frac{1}{n} - x\right) - \tilde{p}$

- **Solve for boundary**
  - $cx - p = c\left(\frac{1}{n} - x\right) - \tilde{p}$
  - $x = \frac{\frac{c}{n} - p + \tilde{p}}{2c}$

- **Interpretation**
  - The boundary $x$ depends on both own price $p$ and neighbour price $\tilde p$

## Salop's circular market: competitive demand and inverse demand

- **Competitive demand**: $q^C = 2x = \frac{\frac{c}{n} - p + \tilde{p}}{c}$

- **Inverse demand**: $p = \frac{c}{n} + \tilde{p} - c q^C$

::: {.callout-important}
## Slope comparison

Competitive-region inverse demand is steeper than monopoly-region inverse demand: $-c$ vs $-\frac{c}{2}$.
:::

## Salop's circular market: kinked demand

- **Firm's choice between regimes**
  - **Monopoly region**: constrained by participation (outside option)
  - **Competitive region**: constrained by neighbours (local oligopoly)

- **Interpretation**
  - As parameters change (e.g. $v, c, n$), the relevant constraint switches, generating a kink in the inverse demand
  - This matters for pricing incentives because marginal revenue changes discretely at the regime boundary

## Salop's circular market: kinked demand (location of kink)

- **Two candidate constraints**
  - **Participation** binds when the marginal consumer is indifferent between firm $i$ and the outside good: $v = p + cd$
  - **Neighbour** competition binds when the marginal consumer is indifferent between firm $i$ and neighbour: $v - cx - p = v - c(\frac{1}{n}-x) - \tilde p$

- **Kink**
  - The relevant constraint switches at the quantity where the two implied boundaries coincide

![](figs/fig-salop-demand-comp-mon.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Salop's circular market: free-entry equilibrium (supply side)

- **Cost structure**
  - $C(q)=F + mq$ with fixed cost $F$ and constant marginal cost $m$
  - Average cost: $AC(q)=m+\frac{F}{q}$ is decreasing in $q$

- **Firm choice in competitive region**
  - Demand: $p = \frac{c}{n} + \tilde{p} - cq$
  - Best response: $MR = MC$ where $MR = \frac{c}{n} + \tilde{p} - 2cq$

- **Assumption**: equilibrium is in competitive region for all firms; by symmetry $\tilde{p} = p$

## Salop's circular market: free-entry equilibrium (zero-profit condition)

- **Symmetric competitive equilibrium**
  - In symmetry: $p=\tilde{p}$ and $q^C=\frac{1}{n}$

- **Zero profit condition (free entry)**
  - $p^C = AC = m + \frac{F}{q^C}$
  - Substitute $q^C = \frac{1}{n}$: $p^C = m + nF$

- **Interpretation**
  - Free entry drives firms to earn zero economic profit
  - Entry cost $F$ creates a trade-off: more firms means lower profit per firm

## Salop's circular market: free-entry equilibrium (first-order condition)

- **First-order condition (optimal quantity)**
  - $MR = MC$ ⇔ $p^C + q^C \frac{dp^C}{dq^C} = m$
  - Slope in competitive region: $\frac{dp}{dq} = -c$
  - Therefore: $p^C - cq^C = m$ ⇔ $p^C = m + \frac{c}{n}$

- **Solve for equilibrium**
  - Equate zero-profit and FOC: $m + nF = m + \frac{c}{n}$
  - $n^C = \sqrt{\frac{c}{F}}$; $p^C = m + \sqrt{cF}$

- **Interpretation**
  - $n^C$ increases with mismatch intensity $c$ (more differentiation supports more firms)
  - $n^C$ decreases with fixed cost $F$ (entry becomes less profitable)

## Salop's circular market: welfare analysis (consumer cost)

- **Welfare object**
  - Consumers' average distance to nearest firm: $\bar d = \frac{1}{4n}$ (half the arc between adjacent firms)
  - Resource cost of variety: $nF$

- **Per-consumer utilitarian welfare**
  - With quasilinear utility, prices are transfers
  - $W(n) = v - \frac{c}{4n} - nF$, where $v = u - u^*$

- **Interpretation**
  - Welfare depends on mismatch costs (↓ in $n$) and fixed entry costs (↑ in $n$)
  - Social planner internalizes both effects; firms do not

## Salop's circular market: welfare analysis (social optimum)

- **Social planner's problem**: choose $n$ to maximize $W(n)$
  - $\frac{dW}{dn} = \frac{c}{4n^2} - F = 0$
  - $n^S = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{c}{F}} = \frac{1}{2} n^C$

- **Equilibrium v optimum**
  - Free-entry equilibrium: $n^C = \sqrt{\frac{c}{F}}$
  - Social optimum: $n^S = \frac{1}{2}n^C$

::: {.callout-important}
## Excess entry

In this benchmark, free entry implies $n^C = 2n^S$.
:::

## Summary & references

**Summary**

- Horizontal differentiation relaxes price competition via consumer mismatch costs
- Hotelling (fixed locations): equilibrium prices increase in transport cost $c$
- Location incentives under linear transport can push toward minimum differentiation; quadratic costs restore a pure-strategy location equilibrium
- Salop (circle): free entry implies $n^C=\sqrt{\frac{c}{F}}$ and excessive entry relative to the social optimum $n^S=\frac{1}{2}n^C$
