## Course Overview

**EC5230 Industrial Organisation**

- **Credits:** 15 (Semester 2, Optional)
- **Instructor:** Prof Gerhard Riener
- **Email:** gr97@st-andrews.ac.uk
- **Office:** G14 Castlecliffe
- **Office Hours:** Wednesday 12–1pm, 2–3pm

## What is Industrial Organisation?

Industrial Organisation studies:

- Structure of firms and markets
- Strategic interactions between firms
- Effects of market power on economic outcomes
- How firms behave in imperfectly competitive markets

## Prerequisites & Expectations

Prerequisites  

- You should remind yourself of basic algebra, calculus (optimisation).  
- A good understanding of intermediate microeconomics concepts  
(market structures, competition, welfare analysis, game  
theory) is essential.  
- Econometric or statistical knowledge is not required.  

Expectations  

- Attend the lectures and tutorials – ask and answer questions.  
- Go through the required readings carefully.  
- Derive (again) the results from lectures, tutorials, readings  
– and reflect on them.  
- Attempt problem set questions before attending the tutorials.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand how Industrial Organisation deepens the analysis of firm behaviour in imperfectly competitive markets
- Select and apply appropriate models to analyse various issues in industrial economics
- Develop skills in analysing economic behaviour through game theory
- Identify and critically evaluate relevant research papers and real-world examples

## Course Structure

- **Lectures:** 10 × 2 hours (Weeks 1–5, 7–9, 11–12; no lecture during Spring Break)
- **Tutorials:** 5 × 1 hour (Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 12)
