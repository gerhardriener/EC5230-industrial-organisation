# Patents and IPRs {background-color="#00539b"}

## IPRs: economic problem

::: {.callout-note title="Object of analysis"}
IPRs make a non-rival good partially excludable, creating private incentives for costly innovation.
:::

- Knowledge is (partly) **non-rival** and often **hard to exclude**
- Without protection, imitation can dissipate rents $\Rightarrow$ weak private incentive to incur fixed R\&D cost

- **Policy objective:** provide incentives for invention while limiting static distortions in product markets

## Learning objectives

- Explain why non-rival ideas can lead to underinvestment without protection
- Use the ideas model to compare the private investment condition $\pi \nu T \ge F$ to the planner objective
- Understand how **length** and **breadth** jointly shape the incentive-distortion trade-off
- Explain why patent races can generate socially excessive duplication

::: {.callout-note title="Today: roadmap"}
1. Patents as incentives: the central trade-off
2. Patent length in the ideas model (screening and welfare)
3. Breadth, endogenous R\&D, and patent races
:::

## IPRs: instruments

- Main IPR types:
  - Patents
  - Trademarks
  - Copyrights
  - Design rights

- Key design dimensions (patents):
  - **Length** (duration)
  - **Breadth** (scope)
  - **Geographical coverage**
  - **Transferability** (sale, licensing)

## IPRs: central trade-off

- Patents create temporary market power $\Rightarrow$ static deadweight loss

- Stronger protection (longer/broader) typically:
  - increases expected private returns to R\&D
  - increases the static distortion during protection

- Questions:
  - What is an optimal **length** and **breadth**?
  - How does competition in R\&D (patent races) affect efficiency?

## Running application (throughout): pharmaceuticals

- Fixed development cost $F$ is large (clinical trials), while marginal cost is low
- Patent protection creates temporary market power, but expiry enables generic entry
- Breadth maps to how close a substitute can be without infringing; races map to multiple labs pursuing the same target

# Scotchmer: ideas model {background-color="#00539b"}

## Ideas model (Scotchmer): primitives

Following @scotchmerInnovationIncentives2006

- An “idea” is a pair $(\nu, F)$

- $\nu$: per-period consumer surplus under competitive supply (value parameter)
- $F$: fixed cost to develop the idea into an innovation (R\&D cost)

- **Interpretation**
  - $\nu$ captures the size of social gains from making the idea usable
  - $F$ is the up-front resource cost required for development

::: {.callout-note title="Application: a new drug"}
Map $(\nu,F)$ to an innovation with large fixed R\&D cost $F$ and a flow of benefits $\nu$ that is partially appropriable during patent protection.
:::

## Ideas model (Scotchmer): social value under discounting

Assume social value lasts forever and the product is competitively supplied.

- Per-period social value: $\nu$

- Discounted social value:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}\nu = \frac{\nu}{r}
$$

- **Interpretation**
  - Discount rate $r$ reduces the present value of long-run benefits
  - Longer-lived benefits (lower $r$) raise the social value of an idea

## Ideas model (Scotchmer): private returns and deadweight loss

- Firm’s per-period private profit under patent: $\pi \nu$ where $0<\pi<1$

- Patent profit for discounted length $T$:

$$
\pi \nu T
$$

- Per-period deadweight loss: $\lambda \nu$ $\Rightarrow$ patent DWL: $\lambda \nu T$

- **Interpretation**
  - $\pi$ is a reduced-form “appropriability” parameter
  - $\lambda$ captures the static distortion created by protection

## Discounted patent length: $T$

- Let $\tau$ be the undiscounted duration (in periods)
- Define discounted duration:

$$
T = \int_0^{\tau} e^{-rt} \, dt = \frac{1-e^{-r\tau}}{r}
$$

- Discrete-time approximation used in many models:

$$
T \approx \sum_{t=1}^{\tau}\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}
$$

- **Interpretation**
  - $T$ is increasing in $\tau$ but bounded as $\tau\to\infty$ when $r>0$

## Optimal patent length: innovating firm

- Patent gives discounted net profit:

$$
\pi \nu T - F
$$

- Firm invests if $\pi \nu T \ge F$

- **Interpretation**
  - Higher $\nu$ or larger $\pi$ reduces the minimum protection needed for investment
  - Higher $F$ requires longer (or stronger) protection to break even

## Optimal patent length: social planner

- Discounted net social value (invention made):

$$
\frac{\nu}{r} - \lambda \nu T
$$

- **Interpretation**
  - Planner values the full flow benefit $\nu$, but counts DWL during protection
  - Optimal design trades off inducing investment against static costs

## Optimal length: heterogeneity and screening (intuition)

- If inventions differ in $(\nu,F)$, “one-size-fits-all” length is not generally optimal

- Comparative statics (holding other parameters fixed):
  - more elastic demand / stronger substitution $\Rightarrow$ higher DWL $\lambda$ $\Rightarrow$ shorter protection
  - higher development cost $F$ $\Rightarrow$ longer protection to ensure investment

## Example: ideas A and B

- Idea A: $(\nu_A=5, F_A=10)$
- Idea B: $(\nu_B=2, F_B=20)$

Let $T=20$, $\pi=\tfrac{1}{2}$, $\lambda=\tfrac{1}{4}$, $r=\tfrac{1}{3}$.

- Tasks:
  - Which ideas are privately profitable ($\pi \nu T \ge F$)?
  - Which ideas have positive discounted net social value $\left(\frac{\nu}{r}-\lambda \nu T - F \ge 0\right)$?

- **Interpretation**
  - With these parameter values, private profitability need not coincide with positive net social value: patent protection can induce investment even when net welfare is negative

# Breadth: product space {background-color="#00539b"}

## Patent breadth: product space (definition)

- Breadth determines how close a substitute can be without infringing

- Reduced-form implication:
  - Narrower breadth $\Rightarrow$ more close substitutes enter
  - Broader breadth $\Rightarrow$ fewer close substitutes enter

- **Interpretation**
  - Allowing close substitutes increases the elasticity of demand faced by the patent holder

::: {.callout-note title="Application: close substitutes"}
In pharmaceuticals, breadth maps to whether a close substitute can launch during protection without infringing.
:::

## Breadth and demand elasticity (intuition)

- If close substitutes are allowed:
  - residual demand becomes **more elastic**
  - equilibrium price is lower (all else equal)

- If substitutes are excluded (broader patent):
  - residual demand is **less elastic**
  - equilibrium price is higher (all else equal)

## Breadth–length trade-off (given a target value)

Assume the “correct” expected private value of protection is fixed.

::: {.callout-note title="Regimes (product space)"}
- Broad–short: $(\hat{T}, \hat{\pi}_1+\hat{\pi}_2)$
- Narrow–long: $(\tilde{T}, \tilde{\pi}_1)$
:::

- Broad patent yields higher per-period profit (includes infringing market):

$$
\hat{T}(\hat{\pi}_1+\hat{\pi}_2)=\tilde{T}\tilde{\pi}_1
$$

- Therefore:

$$
\hat{T}<\tilde{T}
$$

- **Interpretation**
  - Broad protection can be paired with shorter duration to deliver the same incentive level

## Which regime is better?

- The best regime depends on substitution patterns:
  - substitution between the patented good and an infringing substitute
  - substitution between these goods and the rest of consumption

- **Interpretation**
  - Broad–short: more sensitive to outside substitution (pricing alignment across many goods)
  - Narrow–long: more sensitive to within-category substitution

# Optimal patent length with endogenous R&D (Shy) {background-color="#00539b"}

## @shyIndustrialOrganizationTheory1995  model: setup

- Demand: $P(Q)=a-Q$
- Process innovation reduces marginal cost from $c$ to $c-x$
- R\&D effort $x$ costs $R(x)$

- Two-stage game:
  1. Regulator chooses patent duration $\tau$
  2. Firm chooses $x$ to maximise discounted profit

- **Objects**
  - Choice variables: $x$ (firm), $\tau$ (regulator)
  - Parameters: $a,c,r$

## Shy model: firm’s choice of $x$ given $\tau$

Firm solves:

$$
\max_x \ \Pi(x;\tau)=\sum_{t=1}^{\tau}\rho^{t-1}\pi(x)-R(x),
\quad \rho=\frac{1}{1+r}
$$

Assume:

- per-period profit: $\pi(x)=(a-c)\,x$
- cost: $R(x)=\frac{x^2}{2}$

- Lemma:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{\tau}\rho^{t-1}=\frac{1-\rho^\tau}{1-\rho}
$$

## Shy model: induced innovation level

FOC implies:

$$
x^I(\tau)=\frac{1-\rho^\tau}{1-\rho}(a-c)
$$

- Comparative statics:
  - $x^I$ increases with $\tau$
  - $x^I$ increases with $a$ and decreases with $c$
  - $x^I$ increases with $\rho$ (decreases with $r$)

- **Interpretation**
  - Longer protection raises the marginal benefit of R\&D because profits are earned for more discounted periods

## Shy model: planner’s choice of patent duration (statement)

Planner chooses $\tau$ trading off:
- higher induced innovation $x^I(\tau)$
- static deadweight loss under monopoly pricing during protection

- Result (as in Shy): optimal duration is finite, $T^*<\infty$

- **Interpretation**
  - Marginal benefit of longer protection (higher induced $x^I(\tau)$) eventually falls below the marginal cost (additional monopoly distortion during protection)

# Patent races {background-color="#00539b"}

## Symmetric patent race: setup

- Two symmetric firms may incur a fixed cost $f$ to establish a research division
- Success probability: $p$ (per firm)
- Payoffs:
  - monopoly profit if sole innovator: $\pi^m$
  - duopoly profit if both succeed: $\pi^d$

- Welfare benchmarks (post-innovation welfare):
  - one research division: $W^m=\pi^m+CS^m$
  - two research divisions: $W^d=2\pi^d+CS^d$

- Assumption (for the comparison):
  - $CS^d>CS^m$ (more competition in the product market raises consumer surplus)

::: {.callout-note title="Application: parallel R&D programs"}
Think of multiple labs racing to develop the same drug/vaccine: each pays a fixed setup cost and succeeds with some probability.
:::

## Patent race: Nash equilibrium condition

::: {.callout-warning title="Duplication incentive"}
“Winner-takes-all” payoffs can create privately excessive entry into R\&D when firms ignore duplication costs.
:::

- Firms choose $I$ or $NI$ simultaneously
- $(I,I)$ is a Nash equilibrium if:

$$
f \le p(1-p)\pi^m + p^2\pi^d \equiv f^{priv}_2
$$

- **Interpretation**
  - Private incentives include the probability of being the unique winner and the case where both succeed

## Patent race: social optimum condition

- It is socially optimal to have one research division rather than two if:

$$
f \ge p(1-2p)W^m + p^2W^d \equiv f^{publ}_2
$$

- **Interpretation**
  - The planner compares expected welfare under one vs two research divisions, counting duplication cost $f$

## Socially excessive R&D (region)

- Socially excessive duplication occurs when:

$$
f^{publ}_2 < f < f^{priv}_2
$$

- Interpretation:
  - Firms overinvest when the negative externality on rivals’ profits outweighs the consumer-surplus gain from having two innovators

## Numerical check: duplication region

Let $p=0.8$, $\pi^m=10$, $\pi^d=3$, $W^m=15$, $W^d=16$.

- Private two-division threshold:

$$
f^{priv}_2 = p(1-p)\pi^m + p^2\pi^d = 0.8(0.2)10 + 0.64(3) = 3.52
$$

- Social two-division threshold:

$$
f^{publ}_2 = p(1-2p)W^m + p^2W^d = 0.8(-0.6)15 + 0.64(16) = 3.04
$$

- If $f=3.2$, then $f^{publ}_2 < f < f^{priv}_2$: two research divisions are privately viable but socially excessive.

## Summary and next week

**Summary**

- Patents trade off dynamic incentives against static distortions (deadweight loss during protection)
- In the ideas model, investment requires $\pi \nu T \ge F$, while welfare accounts for $\frac{\nu}{r}$ and the DWL term $\lambda \nu T$
- Breadth and length can be substitutes in delivering a given private incentive level (broad–short vs narrow–long)
- Patent races can generate socially excessive duplication when private entry incentives exceed social benefits

**Next week: multi-stage games**

- Commitment and first-mover advantage (Stackelberg)
- Subgame perfect equilibrium and backward induction
- Strategic delegation (Vickers)
