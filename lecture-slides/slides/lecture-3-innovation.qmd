# Innovation and Market Structure {background-color="#00539b"}

## Innovation as a margin of competition

Innovation is the **dynamic** margin of competition: firms try to change the game by shifting **costs** and **demand**.

**Why IO cares**

- Innovation changes **prices, mark-ups, and welfare** today
- Innovation changes **market structure** tomorrow (entry/exit, dominance, concentration)
- Policy trade-off: **static efficiency** (low prices) vs **dynamic efficiency** (strong incentives)

## Types of innovation (and what we model today)

**Process innovation** (this lecture's workhorse case)

- Lowers marginal (or average) cost, e.g. a better production method
- Think: a shift from $c_0$ to $c_1<c_0$

**Product innovation**

- Raises willingness to pay, expands demand, or creates new varieties
- Often analysed with differentiated products and quality ladders (later in the course)

**Stages (high level):** Research → Development → Adoption

## Learning objectives

- Compute the **private value** of a process innovation under different market structures
- Define **drastic vs non-drastic** innovations and explain the **replacement effect** [@arrowEconomicWelfareAllocation1972]
- Understand how **free entry + endogenous R&D** link innovation to **concentration** [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980]

## Discussion: Why does innovation matter for growth?

Before the Industrial Revolution (~1760–1840), global GDP per capita was roughly flat for centuries. Since then, it has grown exponentially.

::: {.callout-note title="Question for you"}
- What role did innovation (new production methods, machinery, transport) play in this transformation?
- Why might market structure affect the *rate* of innovation — and therefore long-run growth?
- Should we expect monopolies or competitive markets to innovate more? (We'll answer this formally in a moment.)
:::

## Market structure and innovation

**Market structure → innovation**

- Competition affects profits, appropriability, and the gain from becoming "better" than rivals

**Innovation → market structure**

- Cost/demand shifts affect entry, market shares, and concentration (and can create dominance)

## Measuring incentives: willingness to pay (WTP)

- **Firm WTP**: the max lump-sum payment that leaves profits unchanged
  $\Rightarrow \ \text{WTP} = \Delta \pi$
- **Planner WTP**: the max lump-sum payment that leaves welfare unchanged
  $\Rightarrow \ \text{WTP} = \Delta W$

In what follows we compute WTP for:
**Monopoly** (before/after), **perfect competition** (before; exclusive rights after), and the **social planner**.

# Benchmarks: Value of a Process Innovation {background-color="#00539b"}

## Setup: linear demand + cost-reducing innovation

**Inverse demand**

$$
P(Q) = A - Q
$$

**Technology**

- Constant marginal cost $c \in \{c_0, c_1\}$
- Process innovation reduces marginal cost from $c_0$ to $c_1$ with $c_1 < c_0 < A$

::: {.callout-note title="Goal"}
Compute the value of moving from $c_0$ to $c_1$ under different market structures.
:::

## Monopoly benchmark: problem and solution

**Problem**

$$
\max_Q \ (A - Q - c)Q
$$

**Solution**

$$
Q^m(c) = \frac{A-c}{2}, \qquad P^m(c) = \frac{A+c}{2}, \qquad \pi^m(c) = \frac{(A-c)^2}{4}
$$

## Monopoly WTP for innovation

**WTP for the innovation**

$$
\Delta \pi^m = \pi^m(c_1) - \pi^m(c_0) = \frac{(A-c_1)^2 - (A-c_0)^2}{4}
$$

::: {.callout-note title="Interpretation"}
$\Delta \pi^m$ is the monopolist's value of *exclusive* access to the lower cost $c_1$ (it is incremental because the firm already earns rents at $c_0$).
:::

## Perfect competition benchmark 

Observation **Innovation creates rents**

**Before innovation (all firms at MC $c_0$):**

- Competitive price: $P^{pc}_0 = c_0$
- Firm profit: $\pi = 0$

**After innovation (innovator has exclusive use / patent):**

- **Drastic**: innovator behaves as a monopolist with cost $c_1$
- **Non-drastic**: innovator is constrained by the competitive fringe at cost $c_0$ (limit pricing)

## Innovation WTP under perfect competition

**Innovator profit / WTP**

$$
\Delta \pi^{pc} =
\begin{cases}
\pi^m(c_1) & \text{(drastic)}\\
(c_0 - c_1)(A - c_0) & \text{(non-drastic, } p=c_0 \text{)}
\end{cases}
$$

**Why the non-drastic formula?** If the innovator sets $p=c_0$, quantity is $Q=A-c_0$, so profits are $(p-c_1)Q=(c_0-c_1)(A-c_0)$.

## Drastic vs non-drastic innovation condition

$$
\text{Drastic: } \;
P^m(c_1) < c_0
\;\Leftrightarrow\;
\frac{A+c_1}{2} < c_0
\;\Leftrightarrow\;
A + c_1 < 2c_0
$$

$$
\text{Non-drastic: } \;
P^m(c_1) \ge c_0
\;\Leftrightarrow\;
\frac{A+c_1}{2} \ge c_0
\;\Leftrightarrow\;
A + c_1 \ge 2c_0
$$

Boundary case: $P^m(c_1)=c_0$ (equivalently $A+c_1=2c_0$).

:::

## Numeric check: drastic or non-drastic?

Use the same values as panel (a): $A=18$, $c_0=10$, and $c_1=6$.

- **Drastic condition**: $A + c_1 = 24 > 2c_0 = 20$ → **non-drastic**
- Innovator limit-prices at $p = c_0 = 10$, sells $Q = A - c_0 = 8$
- Competitive innovator profit: $(c_0 - c_1)(A - c_0) = 4 \times 8 = 32$
- Recall monopoly WTP: $\Delta\pi^m = \frac{(12)^2 - (8)^2}{4} = \frac{144 - 64}{4} = 20$

::: {.callout-note title="Replacement effect preview"}
The competitive innovator earns $32 > 20$ (the monopolist's WTP). The monopolist gains less because it already earns $\pi^m(c_0) = 16$ before innovating — it is partly **replacing** existing rents.
:::

## Replacement effect: visual comparison

- Left panel: the incumbent monopolist already earns $\pi^m(c_0)$ before innovating.
- Innovation raises monopoly profit only by the increment $\pi^m(c_1)-\pi^m(c_0)$.
- Right panel: under competitive pre-innovation conditions, the innovation mostly **creates** rents.

:::

## Replacement effect [@arrowEconomicWelfareAllocation1972]

- The key object is the **incremental** value of innovation.
- Competitive benchmark: pre-innovation profits are approximately zero, so $\Delta\pi^{pc} \approx \pi_{\text{after}}^{pc}$.
- Monopoly benchmark: pre-innovation profits are positive, so $\Delta\pi^{m} = \pi_{\text{after}}^{m} - \pi^{m}(c_0)$.
- This gap in incremental value is the **replacement effect**.

## Drastic benchmark: one-line wedge

If innovation is drastic and grants exclusive rights:

$$
\Delta \pi^{pc} = \pi^m(c_1), \qquad \Delta \pi^m = \pi^m(c_1) - \pi^m(c_0)
$$


$$
\Delta \pi^{pc} - \Delta \pi^m = \pi^m(c_0) > 0
$$

- The wedge equals pre-innovation monopoly rents, $\pi^m(c_0)$.
- The replacement effect is strongest when baseline monopoly rents are high.

## Replacement effect: intuition

::: {.callout-important title="Takeaway"}
Holding everything else fixed, an incumbent monopolist has **weaker** incentives to innovate than a competitive industry because it is "replacing" its own pre-innovation rents.
:::

## Appropriability and imitation

- If the innovation cannot be protected (instant diffusion / perfect imitation), competition drives price to $c_1$ and the innovator's WTP is zero.
- Most IO policy questions start from imperfect but positive appropriability (patents, secrecy, lead time).

## Empirical example: competition and innovation

- Low competition: firms have little pressure to "escape."
- Intermediate competition: innovation incentives are strongest for neck-and-neck firms.
- Very high competition: post-innovation rents are compressed, reducing innovation incentives.

::: {.callout-note title="Inverted-U evidence (QJE)"}
@aghionCompetitionInnovationInvertedU2005 document an **inverted-U** relationship between product-market competition and innovation (patents/citations) in UK firms, consistent with "escape competition" incentives for neck-and-neck firms and a **replacement effect** for laggards.

# Social Value of Innovation {background-color="#00539b"}

## Social planner: value of a cost reduction

After the private-value benchmarks, we now switch to the **social objective**.

**Efficient output** (price equals marginal cost)

$$
Q^{sp}(c) = A - c
$$

**Total surplus (welfare):**

$$
W(c) = \int_0^{A-c} (A - Q - c) \, dQ = \frac{(A-c)^2}{2}
$$

::: {.callout-note title="Interpretation"}
In this linear example, $\Delta W = 2\,\Delta \pi^m$: the planner values the output expansion that the monopolist does not internalise.
:::

## Social planner WTP for innovation

**Max WTP for innovation (social planner):**

$$
\Delta W = W(c_1) - W(c_0) = \frac{(A-c_1)^2 - (A-c_0)^2}{2}
$$

- This is the full increase in total surplus from lowering marginal cost.
- In the linear benchmark, it is exactly twice the monopoly incremental profit.

## Putting the benchmarks side-by-side

| Environment | What the innovator captures | WTP / value |
|---|---|---|
| Monopoly (incumbent) | Incremental rents | $\Delta\pi^m=\pi^m(c_1)-\pi^m(c_0)$ |
| Perfect competition (pre) + exclusive rights (post) | Mostly created rents | $\Delta\pi^{pc}=\pi^m(c_1)$ if drastic; otherwise limit pricing profit |
| Social planner | Full surplus gain | $\Delta W=W(c_1)-W(c_0)$ |

::: {.callout-important title="Policy interpretation"}
Private incentives and social value need not align: **$\Delta W$ can exceed $\Delta\pi$**, but market power created by IPRs also generates static distortions. This is the basic patents trade-off.
:::

## Empirical example: private vs social returns

- Measured producer gains capture only part of innovation's value.
- Consumer surplus from quality improvements can be very large.
- This gap motivates policy tools that raise private appropriability.

::: {.callout-note title="Welfare gains from product innovation (JPE)"}
@trajtenbergWelfareAnalysisProduct1989  estimates consumer and producer surplus gains from quality improvements in computed tomography (CT) scanners, illustrating that the **social value** of innovation can greatly exceed the innovator's private returns.
:::

## Quick numeric check (optional)

Using the same calibration as earlier ($A=18$, $c_0=10$, $c_1=6$):

- Monopoly: $\pi^m(c_0)=16$, $\pi^m(c_1)=36$, so $\Delta\pi^m=20$
- Planner: $W(c_0)=32$, $W(c_1)=72$, so $\Delta W=40$ (twice the monopoly gain)

::: {.callout-note title="Discussion question"}
In what sense is this "too little" innovation from a welfare perspective? What policy instruments could close the gap?
:::

# Innovation with Rivals and Entry {background-color="#00539b"}

## Incentives to innovate with rivals: intuition first

We now move from benchmark environments to **strategic interaction** with rivals and entry threat.

Innovation incentives are not monotone in "competition intensity."

- They depend on market structure ($n$, differentiation, price vs quantity competition).
- They depend on technology and institutions (protectability, spillovers).

::: {.callout-note title="Rule of thumb"}
More rivals reduce baseline profits (discouraging innovation), but can raise the value of becoming the low-cost firm (encouraging innovation).
:::

## Number of rivals: Cournot intuition

In linear Cournot, R&D incentives can follow an **inverse-U** as $n$ rises:

- **Competition effect:** more firms compress profits for everyone.
- **Competitive advantage effect:** a cost lead is more valuable when many higher-cost rivals remain.

Which force dominates is an empirical question and can vary by industry.

## Entry threat framework: incumbent vs entrant

Consider an incumbent monopolist facing a potential entrant:

- Innovation lowers marginal cost from $c_0$ to $c_1<c_0$.
- The entrant can profitably enter only if it obtains the innovation.
- Let $\pi^d(c_i,c_j)$ be firm $i$'s duopoly profit when own cost is $c_i$ and rival cost is $c_j$.

Timing:

1. Firms compete for innovation (patent auction / R\&D race).
2. Innovation is allocated to the higher-valuation firm.
3. Entry decision and product-market competition occur after allocation.

## Who values innovation more?

Payoff logic by winner:

- If the **incumbent** wins: market stays monopoly, payoff $\pi^m(c_1)$.
- If the **entrant** wins: entry occurs, payoffs become $\pi^d(c_0,c_1)$ for the incumbent and $\pi^d(c_1,c_0)$ for the entrant.

So per-period valuations are:

$$
V_I = \pi^m(c_1) - \pi^d(c_0, c_1), \qquad
V_E = \pi^d(c_1, c_0)
$$

## Entry threat: pre-emption condition [@gilbertPreemptivePatentingPersistence1982]

The incumbent has stronger innovation incentives when:

$$
V_I > V_E
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
\pi^m(c_1) > \pi^d(c_1, c_0) + \pi^d(c_0, c_1)
$$

This is more likely when products are close substitutes, so entry would sharply reduce incumbent profits.

::: {.callout-important title="Interpretation"}
For incumbents, innovation has a **dual payoff**: efficiency gain (lower cost) plus market-structure protection (deterring entry). That is the pre-emption channel.
:::

## Discussion: when does pre-emption fail?

::: {.callout-note title="Discussion question"}
Under what market conditions might an entrant have stronger innovation incentives than the incumbent? What features would reverse the pre-emption result?
:::

## Answer: when entrant incentives dominate

Entrant incentives are stronger when:

$$
V_E > V_I
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
\pi^d(c_1,c_0) + \pi^d(c_0,c_1) > \pi^m(c_1)
$$

- **Weak business-stealing effect**: products are more differentiated, so entry hurts the incumbent less.
- **Low market-structure protection value**: moving from duopoly to monopoly is not worth much to the incumbent.
- **High entrant upside from innovation**: entrant post-entry profits $\pi^d(c_1,c_0)$ are large (e.g., efficient entry, strong demand segment).
- **Large incumbent replacement effect**: the incumbent already has substantial rents without innovating, so incremental gains are limited.
- **Weaker appropriability for incumbents** (strong spillovers/imitation): innovation is less effective as an entry-deterrence tool.

::: {.callout-important title="Bottom line"}
Pre-emption fails when the incumbent's **entry-deterrence motive is weak** and the entrant's **duopoly gain from innovating is strong**.
:::

## Empirical example: strategic incentives and market share

::: {.callout-note title="Pre-emptive innovation patterns (ReStud)"}
@blundellMarketShareMarket1999 find that higher market share and market value predict more patenting/innovations in UK manufacturing firms, consistent with **strategic** incentives (including pre-emptive innovation) in oligopolistic industries.

# Endogenous R&D and Market Structure: @dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980 {background-color="#00539b"}

## Big Question

In Dasgupta-Stiglitz, firms choose R&D and entry is endogenous.  
The central question is: **what jointly determines innovation intensity and concentration?**

This final model puts both objects, $x$ and $N$, inside one equilibrium system.

Key forces:

- **Demand conditions** (elasticity, market size)
- **R&D technology** (how effectively spending lowers cost)
- **Free entry** (how many firms can cover R&D outlays)

## Notation for this section

| Symbol | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| $x$ | Choice | R&D expenditure per firm |
| $c(x)$ | Function | Marginal cost, with $c'(x)<0$ |
| $N$ | Outcome | Number of active firms (endogenous) |
| $\varepsilon$ | Parameter | Market demand elasticity |
| $\alpha$ | Parameter | R&D cost elasticity, $\alpha=-\frac{dc(x)}{dx}\frac{x}{c}$ |

## Planner benchmark: why scale matters

Planner problem:

$$
\max_{x,Q}\; V(x,Q)=U(Q)-c(x)Q-x
$$

FOC for R&D:

$$
-c'(x)Q=1
$$

Interpretation: the marginal benefit of R&D is proportional to output scale $Q$, so larger markets justify more cost-reducing innovation.

## Empirical anchor: market size and innovation

::: {.callout-note title="Pharmaceutical innovation responds to demand"}
@acemogluMarketSizeInnovation2004 show that larger potential markets lead to:

- more pharmaceutical innovation (new drugs / new molecular entities)
- consistent evidence that innovation incentives rise with market scale
:::

## Industry side: firms choose output and R&D

Assume symmetric Cournot competition. Firm $i$ solves:

$$
\max_{x_i,q_i}\; \pi_i=[P(Q)-c(x_i)]q_i-x_i,\qquad Q=q_i+q_{-i}
$$

In symmetric equilibrium, $q_i^*=Q^*/N^*$ and $x_i^*=x^*$.

## Two equilibrium conditions

From Cournot pricing (perceived elasticity $N\varepsilon$):

$$
\frac{P-c}{P}=\frac{1}{N\varepsilon}
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
P-c=\frac{P}{N\varepsilon}
$$

From free entry (zero profit):

$$
(P-c)\frac{Q}{N}-x=0
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
P-c=\frac{Nx}{Q}
$$

Entry continues until operating margins exactly cover per-firm R&D spending.

## Deriving concentration in one step

Equate the two expressions for the margin:

$$
\frac{P}{N\varepsilon}=\frac{Nx}{Q}
$$

Use the R&D elasticity definition with the R&D FOC ($-c'(x)q=1$), which implies:

$$
\frac{x}{q}=\alpha c
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\frac{Nx}{Q}=\alpha c
$$

where symmetry implies $q=Q/N$.

So:

$$
\frac{P}{N\varepsilon}=\alpha c
$$

Divide by $P$ and substitute $c/P=1-\frac{1}{N\varepsilon}$:

$$
\frac{1}{N\varepsilon}
=
\alpha\!\left(1-\frac{1}{N\varepsilon}\right)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\frac{1}{N^*}
=
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\cdot\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}
$$

## Core result: equilibrium concentration

$$
\frac{1}{N^*}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\cdot\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}
$$

::: {.callout-note title="Interpretation"}
Concentration and innovation are jointly determined.  
Higher R&D effectiveness ($\alpha$) supports higher concentration, while more elastic demand ($\varepsilon$) supports lower concentration.
:::

## Numerical check

Using $\frac{1}{N^*}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\cdot\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}$:

- If $\varepsilon=2$ and $\alpha=1$, then $\frac{1}{N^*}=\frac{1}{4}$ so $N^*=4$.
- If $\varepsilon=2$ and $\alpha=3$, then $\frac{1}{N^*}=\frac{3}{8}$ so $N^*\approx2.7$.

::: {.callout-note title="Discussion question"}
If policy raises R&D effectiveness ($\alpha$), the model predicts **more concentration** (lower $N^*$).  
When is that welfare-improving once we account for both dynamic gains and static mark-up losses?
:::

## Comparative statics and trade-offs

With $P(Q)=\sigma Q^{-\varepsilon}$ and $c(x)=\beta x^{-\alpha}$:

- Here, $\sigma>0$ is a demand-level (market-size) shifter.
- $\frac{\partial(1/N^*)}{\partial\alpha}>0$: more effective R&D tends to increase concentration.
- $\frac{\partial(1/N^*)}{\partial\varepsilon}<0$: more elastic demand tends to reduce concentration.
- $\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial \sigma}>0$: larger markets raise R&D effort.
- Typically, $x^*(N+1)<x^*(N)$ but $Q^*(N+1)>Q^*(N)$: more firms improve static efficiency yet can weaken per-firm innovation incentives.

This is the core dynamic-static tension in endogenous market-structure models.

# Addendum: Welfare Standards in Competition Policy (Consumer vs Total Surplus) {background-color="#00539b"}

## Competition policy as applied IO

 every merger/abuse case implicitly answers:

- **What counts as harm?** (prices? quality? innovation? rivals?)
- **Whose welfare counts?** consumers only, or consumers + producers?
- **How are trade-offs treated?** (efficiency vs market power; static vs dynamic)

*Welfare standard* choice and what it implies for enforcement design:

- Normative welfare economics + distribution separation
- Neven & Röller : political economy of the welfare standard
- Farrell & Katz: institutional/process critique of the "welfare standard debate"
- @williamsonEconomiesAntitrustDefense1968: the classic *efficiency–market power* trade-off formalization

::: {.callout-note title="Key takeaway"}
The "consumer surplus vs total surplus" are philosophical and political arguments: it changes
(i) which efficiencies matter, (ii) how evidence is organized, and (iii) which cases are brought.
:::

## Kaplow's choosing a welfare standard

- **Consumer welfare / consumer surplus (CS)**: weight consumers; producer gains may not offset consumer losses.
- **Total welfare (TW)**: CS + producer surplus (PS); standard Kaldor–Hicks social surplus.

Kaplow's two core issues:

1. **Distribution**: does CS better protect poorer consumers?
2. **Policy design**: if distribution matters, should it be handled by *competition law* or by *tax/transfer*?

## Kaplow's central claim

The canonical welfare-econ logic in Kaplow:

- If society cares about distribution, it is (usually) **more efficient to address it through the tax/transfer system**
  rather than by distorting product-market rules case-by-case.
- Therefore, a switch from TW to CS *to pursue distributional goals* is typically a second-best instrument.

Implication:

- A TW standard is often normatively preferred **unless** taxes/transfers are unavailable or severely constrained.


## Practical reading of Kaplow for IO

For applied IO (mergers/abuse):

- Under **TW**, an efficiency gain can offset a price increase if the *net surplus* rises.
- Under **CS**, you often need **pass-through**: efficiencies must prevent consumers from being harmed.

This difference is large in cost-reduction mergers, vertical restraints, and platform settings where
PS can increase even when short-run prices rise.

## @nevenConsumerSurplusVs2005 merger control 

Political economy problem: **common-agency** 

- Merging firms and rivals can **lobby/influence** the agency.
- Consumers are often **diffuse** and (in many designs) are modeled as *not lobbying*.

**Question:** Which welfare standard (CS vs TW) yields better outcomes when enforcement is politically influenced?

## Main result (intuition)

A CS standard can be *strategically robust* in some political environments because:

- TW gives more "credit" to producer gains (incl. gains captured by concentrated interests),
  which can amplify lobbying distortions.
- If firms/rivals are the effective political actors, a CS standard can act as a **commitment device**
  against rent-seeking that masquerades as "efficiency".

Conclusion: *even if TW is normatively attractive*, CS may dominate when institutions are captured or non-transparent.

::: {.notes}
This is the bridge from "welfare economics" to "agency design":

- A welfare standard is partly a **mechanism design** choice under political constraints.
- Predictions depend on:
  - transparency of proceedings,
  - ability of consumers/third parties to participate,
  - coordination costs among firms/rivals,
  - how merger size changes rents.

Use this to interpret why legal systems embed "consumer not worse off" constraints.
:::

## @farrellEconomicsWelfareStandards2006 "antitrust is not straightforwardly welfarist"

Argue the CS vs TW debate misses two big points:

1. Antitrust often **protects a process** (e.g., competition) rather than maximizing a welfare function directly.
2. Enforcement is built on **administrability, presumptions, and error costs**, not full-information welfare maximization.

They emphasize that legal rules must be operational under uncertainty:

- burdens of proof,
- evidentiary screens,
- per se vs rule-of-reason structure,
- predictability and deterrence.

## "Error costs"

Even if you pick CS or TW, what courts/agencies *do* is mediated by:

- **Screens** (market definition, market power, foreclosure shares)
- **Presumptions** (e.g., certain concentration thresholds)
- **Type I vs Type II errors** (false positives vs false negatives)

- The welfare standard debate is often a proxy for deeper disagreements about  how to manage uncertainty, litigation cost, and institutional competence. 

## IO takeaway: welfare standard vs decision procedure

In IO terms:
- Welfare standard = objective function.
- Decision procedure = constrained optimization with limited observables.

So the "real" question in many jurisdictions:
- Which standard yields **better implementable rules** under information and political constraints?

## @williamsonEconomiesAntitrustDefense1968 the trade-off diagram, formalized

Core contribution:

- A merger can create **cost savings** (efficiency rectangle) but also increase **market power** causing **deadweight loss** and **transfers**.

In the simplest partial equilibrium picture:

- Price rises from competition toward monopoly
- Output falls
- Consumers lose (transfer + DWL)
- Producers gain (transfer)
- Efficiencies may offset DWL and can even raise TW.


# Implementation in real policy {background-color="#00539b"}

## EU Commission: "consumers will not be worse off" (efficiencies in merger control)

In the EU Horizontal Merger Guidelines, the benchmark for efficiencies is explicitly consumer-facing:

- The relevant benchmark is that **consumers will not be worse off** as a result of the merger (efficiencies must benefit consumers in the relevant markets, in a timely and verifiable way).

This is the practical embodiment of a CS-style constraint.

**Operational implication (what gets litigated):**
- quantification and verifiability of efficiencies,
- timing (short/medium run),
- *pass-through* and competitive constraints.

## EU enforcement priorities: "most harmful to consumers"

The Commission's effects-based language in Article 102 enforcement priorities is framed in terms of conduct "most harmful to consumers," consistent with consumer-harm screens.

Interpretation for IO:

- Evidence is organized around price/quality/choice/innovation harms to customers, not around a fully aggregated surplus calculus.


## Canada: efficiencies "trade-off" logic (historical centerpiece)

Canada is the canonical example where merger review historically embedded a stronger **total welfare**
logic via an efficiencies trade-off approach in agency guidance:

- The Bureau's Merger Enforcement Guidelines (2011) discuss efficiencies and their role in assessment. 

**Operational implication:**
- parties invest heavily in measuring cost savings and productive efficiencies,
- the analysis is closer to a Williamson-style TW balancing exercise,
- distributional concerns are less directly built into the test than in a strict CS regime.


## Australia: "public benefit" / society-wide welfare language

Australia's merger guidelines and authorization practice explicitly frame the objective in broad welfare terms
("welfare of Australians", "society as a whole", best use of resources):

- This is naturally aligned with **total welfare / net public benefit** balancing.

Operational implication:
- broader categories of benefits can enter (beyond short-run consumer prices),
- the authority can explicitly weigh economy-wide resource allocation effects.


## Summary and next week

**Summary**

- Innovation value depends on the objective: **$\Delta \pi$ (private)** versus **$\Delta W$ (social)**
- Replacement effect: pre-innovation rents reduce the incumbent's incremental gain from innovation
- With entry threat, innovation can be worth more because it changes **market structure** (monopoly vs duopoly)
- In oligopoly, incentives reflect competing forces (competition effect vs competitive advantage effect)

**Next week: patents and IPRs**

- Patents as incentives: monopoly rights vs. dynamic efficiency
- Patent races and timing
- Disclosure, licensing, and welfare
- Horizontal and vertical innovation (brief)
