# Innovation and Market Structure {background-color="#00539b"}

## Innovation as a margin of competition

Innovation is the **dynamic** margin of competition: firms try to change the game by shifting **costs** and **demand**.

**Why IO cares**

- Innovation changes **prices, mark-ups, and welfare** today
- Innovation changes **market structure** tomorrow (entry/exit, dominance, concentration)
- Policy trade-off: **static efficiency** (low prices) vs **dynamic efficiency** (strong incentives)

## Types of innovation (and what we model today)

**Process innovation** (this lecture's workhorse case)

- Lowers marginal (or average) cost, e.g. a better production method
- Think: a shift from $c_0$ to $c_1<c_0$

**Product innovation**

- Raises willingness to pay, expands demand, or creates new varieties
- Often analysed with differentiated products and quality ladders (later in the course)

**Stages (high level):** Research → Development → Adoption

## Learning objectives

- Compute the **private value** of a process innovation under different market structures
- Define **drastic vs non-drastic** innovations and explain the **replacement effect** [@arrowEconomicWelfareAllocation1972]
- Understand why innovation can have **strategic value** when it affects **entry** and market structure
- See how models with **free entry + endogenous R&D** link innovation to **concentration** [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980]

## Market structure and innovation: a two-way relationship

**Market structure → innovation**

- Competition affects profits, appropriability, and the gain from becoming "better" than rivals

**Innovation → market structure**

- Cost/demand shifts affect entry, market shares, and concentration (and can create dominance)

## Measuring incentives: willingness to pay (WTP)

- **Firm WTP**: the max lump-sum payment that leaves profits unchanged
  $\Rightarrow \ \text{WTP} = \Delta \pi$
- **Planner WTP**: the max lump-sum payment that leaves welfare unchanged
  $\Rightarrow \ \text{WTP} = \Delta W$

In what follows we compute WTP for:
**Monopoly** (before/after), **perfect competition** (before; exclusive rights after), and the **social planner**.

# Benchmarks: Value of a Process Innovation {background-color="#00539b"}

## Setup: linear demand + cost-reducing innovation

**Inverse demand**

$$
P(Q) = A - Q
$$

**Technology**

- Constant marginal cost $c \in \{c_0, c_1\}$
- Process innovation reduces marginal cost from $c_0$ to $c_1$ with $c_1 < c_0 < A$

::: {.callout-note title="Goal"}
Compute the value of moving from $c_0$ to $c_1$ under different market structures.
:::

## Monopoly benchmark: problem and solution

**Problem**

$$
\max_Q \ (A - Q - c)Q
$$

**Solution**

$$
Q^m(c) = \frac{A-c}{2}, \qquad P^m(c) = \frac{A+c}{2}, \qquad \pi^m(c) = \frac{(A-c)^2}{4}
$$

## Monopoly WTP for innovation

**WTP for the innovation**

$$
\Delta \pi^m = \pi^m(c_1) - \pi^m(c_0) = \frac{(A-c_1)^2 - (A-c_0)^2}{4}
$$

::: {.callout-note title="Interpretation"}
$\Delta \pi^m$ is the monopolist's value of *exclusive* access to the lower cost $c_1$ (it is incremental because the firm already earns rents at $c_0$).
:::

## Discussion: Why does innovation matter for growth?

Before the Industrial Revolution (~1760–1840), global GDP per capita was roughly flat for centuries. Since then, it has grown exponentially.

**Question for you:**

- What role did innovation (new production methods, machinery, transport) play in this transformation?
- Why might market structure affect the *rate* of innovation — and therefore long-run growth?
- Should we expect monopolies or competitive markets to innovate more? (We'll answer this formally in a moment.)

## Perfect competition benchmark (innovation creates rents)

**Before innovation (all firms at MC $c_0$):**

- Competitive price: $P^{pc}_0 = c_0$
- Firm profit: $\pi = 0$

**After innovation (innovator has exclusive use / patent):**

- **Drastic**: innovator behaves as a monopolist with cost $c_1$
- **Non-drastic**: innovator is constrained by the competitive fringe at cost $c_0$ (limit pricing)

**Innovator profit / WTP**

$$
\Delta \pi^{pc} =
\begin{cases}
\pi^m(c_1) & \text{(drastic)}\\
(c_0 - c_1)(A - c_0) & \text{(non-drastic, } p=c_0 \text{)}
\end{cases}
$$

**Why the non-drastic formula?** If the innovator sets $p=c_0$, quantity is $Q=A-c_0$, so profits are $(p-c_1)Q=(c_0-c_1)(A-c_0)$.

## Drastic innovation condition

$$
P^m(c_1) < c_0
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
\frac{A+c_1}{2} < c_0
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
A + c_1 < 2c_0
$$

![](../figs/fig-innovation-drastic-threshold.svg){fig-alt="Demand-cost diagram showing drastic vs non-drastic innovation threshold" fig-align="center" width="80%"}
:::

## Numeric check: drastic or non-drastic?

Take $A=20$, $c_0=10$, and $c_1=6$.

- **Drastic condition**: $A + c_1 = 26 > 2c_0 = 20$ → **non-drastic**
- Innovator limit-prices at $p = c_0 = 10$, sells $Q = A - c_0 = 10$
- Competitive innovator profit: $(c_0 - c_1)(A - c_0) = 4 \times 10 = 40$
- Recall monopoly WTP: $\Delta\pi^m = \frac{(14)^2 - (10)^2}{4} = \frac{196 - 100}{4} = 24$

::: {.callout-note title="Replacement effect preview"}
The competitive innovator earns $40 > 24$ (the monopolist's WTP). The monopolist gains less because it already earns $\pi^m(c_0) = 25$ before innovating — it is partly **replacing** existing rents.
:::

## Replacement effect [@arrowEconomicWelfareAllocation1972]

::: {.callout-note title="Key idea (replacement effect)"}
Under perfect competition, pre-innovation profits are zero, so innovation mainly **creates** rents. Under monopoly, innovation partly **replaces** existing rents.
:::

## Appropriability and imitation

*If the innovation cannot be protected (instant diffusion / perfect imitation), competition drives price to $c_1$ and the innovator's WTP is zero. Most IO policy questions start from the fact that appropriability is imperfect but positive (patents, secrecy, lead time).*

## Replacement effect: a one-line comparison (drastic case)

If the innovation is drastic and grants exclusive rights:

$$
\Delta \pi^{pc} = \pi^m(c_1), \qquad \Delta \pi^m = \pi^m(c_1) - \pi^m(c_0)
$$

. . .

$$
\Delta \pi^{pc} - \Delta \pi^m = \pi^m(c_0) > 0
$$

::: {.callout-important title="Takeaway"}
Holding everything else fixed, an incumbent monopolist has **weaker** incentives to innovate than a competitive industry because it is "replacing" its own pre-innovation rents.

[@aghionCompetitionInnovationInvertedU2005] document an **inverted-U** relationship between product-market competition and innovation (patents/citations) in UK firms, consistent with "escape competition" incentives for neck-and-neck firms and a **replacement effect** for laggards.

## Social planner: value of a cost reduction

**Efficient output** (price equals marginal cost)

$$
Q^{sp}(c) = A - c
$$

**Total surplus (welfare):**

$$
W(c) = \int_0^{A-c} (A - Q - c) \, dQ = \frac{(A-c)^2}{2}
$$

::: {.callout-note title="Interpretation"}
In this linear example, $\Delta W = 2\,\Delta \pi^m$: the planner values the output expansion that the monopolist does not internalise.
:::

## Social planner WTP for innovation

**Max WTP for innovation (social planner):**

$$
\Delta W = W(c_1) - W(c_0) = \frac{(A-c_1)^2 - (A-c_0)^2}{2}
$$

## Putting the benchmarks side-by-side

| Environment | What the innovator captures | WTP / value |
|---|---|---|
| Monopoly (incumbent) | Incremental rents | $\Delta\pi^m=\pi^m(c_1)-\pi^m(c_0)$ |
| Perfect competition (pre) + exclusive rights (post) | Mostly created rents | $\Delta\pi^{pc}=\pi^m(c_1)$ if drastic; otherwise limit pricing profit |
| Social planner | Full surplus gain | $\Delta W=W(c_1)-W(c_0)$ |

::: {.callout-important title="Policy interpretation"}
Private incentives and social value need not align: **$\Delta W$ can exceed $\Delta\pi$**, but market power created by IPRs also generates static distortions. This is the basic patents trade-off.
:::

## Empirical example: private vs social returns

::: {.callout-note title="Welfare gains from product innovation (JPE)"}
Trajtenberg (1989) estimates consumer and producer surplus gains from quality improvements in computed tomography (CT) scanners, illustrating that the **social value** of innovation can greatly exceed the innovator's private returns. [@trajtenbergWelfareAnalysisProduct1989]
:::

## Quick numeric check (optional)

Take $A=20$, $c_0=10$, and $c_1=6$.

- Monopoly: $\pi^m(c_0)=25$, $\pi^m(c_1)=49$, so $\Delta\pi^m=24$
- Planner: $W(c_0)=50$, $W(c_1)=98$, so $\Delta W=48$ (twice the monopoly gain)

::: {.callout-note title="Discussion question"}
In what sense is this "too little" innovation from a welfare perspective? What policy instruments could close the gap?

# Innovation with Rivals and Entry {background-color="#00539b"}

## Incentives to innovate in oligopoly

**Takeaway**

- Innovation incentives need not be monotone in "competition intensity"
- They depend on:
  - Number of firms ($n$)
  - Product differentiation
  - Mode of competition (price vs quantity)
  - Whether innovation is **protectable** (patents/lead time) and whether there are **spillovers**

::: {.callout-note title="Rule of thumb"}
More rivals reduces baseline profits (hurting incentives), but can increase the value of being the low-cost firm (helping incentives).
:::

## Impact of number of firms (Cournot intuition)

**Linear Cournot with $n$ firms**: incentives can follow an **inverse-U** as $n$ increases.

**Two opposing effects as $n \uparrow$:**

- **Competition effect**: profits for all firms fall (discourages innovation)
- **Competitive advantage effect**: cost advantage becomes more valuable when there are more inefficient rivals (encourages innovation)

## Monopoly threatened by entry: setup

**Incumbent monopoly faces potential entrant:**

- Both can acquire innovation reducing MC from $c_0$ to $c_1 < c_0$
- Entrant can enter profitably **only if** it gets innovation
- Let $\pi^d(c_i,c_j)$ denote firm $i$'s profit in the post-entry **duopoly** when own cost is $c_i$ and the rival's cost is $c_j$

**Payoffs:**

- **If incumbent gets innovation**: entrant stays out
  - Incumbent: $\pi^m(c_1)$; Entrant: $0$
- **If entrant gets innovation**: entrant enters
  - Incumbent: $\pi^d(c_0, c_1)$; Entrant: $\pi^d(c_1, c_0)$

::: {.callout-note title="Strategic value"}
Innovation can change market structure (monopoly vs duopoly), so incentives are not only about production efficiency.
:::

## Entry threat: pre-emption incentives [@gilbertPreemptivePatentingPersistence1982]

**Per-period value of innovation**

$$
V_I = \pi^m(c_1) - \pi^d(c_0, c_1)
$$

$$
V_E = \pi^d(c_1, c_0)
$$

**Incumbent has stronger incentives if**

. . .

$$
V_I > V_E \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \pi^m(c_1) > \pi^d(c_1, c_0) + \pi^d(c_0, c_1)
$$

Typically when products are close substitutes (entry is very harmful).

::: {.callout-important title="Interpretation"}
Here the incumbent may innovate **more** than an entrant because innovation does two things at once: it lowers cost *and* it keeps the market in the monopoly regime (entry deterrence / pre-emption).
:::

## Discussion: when does pre-emption fail?

Under what market conditions might an entrant have stronger innovation incentives than the incumbent? What features would reverse the pre-emption result?

## Empirical example: strategic incentives and market share

::: {.callout-note title="Pre-emptive innovation patterns (ReStud)"}
Blundell, Griffith, and Van Reenen (1999) find that higher market share and market value predict more patenting/innovations in UK manufacturing firms, consistent with **strategic** incentives (including pre-emptive innovation) in oligopolistic industries. [@blundellMarketShareMarket1999]

# Seminal Contributions {background-color="#00539b"}

## Dasgupta–Stiglitz: endogenous R&D and market structure [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980]

They model R&D as an **endogenous sunk cost**: firms spend on R&D to reduce marginal cost, and entry adjusts endogenously.

The key result is a clean link between:

- **Demand conditions** (elasticity, market size)
- **Innovative opportunities** (how effective R&D is at lowering costs)
- **Equilibrium concentration** (how many firms survive under free entry)

The linear model gave us clean closed-form comparisons. The D-S framework sacrifices tractability for generality — but delivers a structural result linking innovation to concentration.

::: {.callout-note title="Notation for this section"}

:::

## Dasgupta–Stiglitz (1980): planner benchmark [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980]

**Question**: Do more firms imply more innovation?

**Primitives:**

- $U(Q)$ = gross social benefit
- $c = c(x)$ = constant marginal cost depending on R&D expenditure $x$
- Assumption: $c'(x) < 0$ (R&D reduces cost)

**Social optimum:**

$$
\max_{x,Q} \ V(x,Q) = U(Q) - c(x)Q - x
$$

**First-order condition in $x$:**

$$
-c'(x)Q = 1
$$

## Planner benchmark: interpretation

- Optimal R&D increases with scale $Q$: a larger market makes cost reduction more valuable

## Empirical example: market size and innovation

::: {.callout-note title="Pharmaceutical innovation responds to demand (QJE)"}
Acemoglu and Linn (2004) show that larger potential markets lead to more pharmaceutical innovation (new drugs/new molecular entities), consistent with models where the return to innovation rises with **scale**. [@acemogluMarketSizeInnovation2004]
:::

## Dasgupta–Stiglitz (1980): firm's problem [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980]

**Firm $i$'s problem (symmetric firms):**

$$
\max_{x_i, q_i} \ \pi(x_i, q_i) = [P(q_i + q_{-i}) - c(x_i)]q_i - x_i
$$

**Symmetric equilibrium:**

- $q_1^* = \cdots = q_N^* = Q^*/N$ and $x_1^* = \cdots = x_N^* = x^*$

## Dasgupta–Stiglitz (1980): equilibrium pricing [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980]

**First-order condition in $q_i$:**

$$
P(Q^*)\left(1 - \frac{1}{N\varepsilon}\right) = c(x^*)
$$

where $\varepsilon = -\frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\frac{P}{Q}$ is the demand elasticity.

**Interpretation:**

- The term $\left(1-\frac{1}{N\varepsilon}\right)$ captures market power via the perceived demand elasticity under Cournot
  - More firms ($N\uparrow$) → perceived demand becomes more elastic → mark-ups fall

## Free entry condition [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980]

**Zero profit condition** (free entry):

$$
\pi = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (P - c)\frac{Q^*}{N^*} - x^* = 0
$$

**Rearrange:**

$$
P - c = N^* \frac{x^*}{Q^*}
$$

## Deriving the concentration formula (I): Setup

**Combine the two conditions:**

- From pricing FOC: $P - c = \frac{P}{N\varepsilon}$
- From free entry: $P - c = \frac{Nx}{Q}$

**Equating the two expressions:**

$$
\frac{P}{N\varepsilon} = \frac{Nx}{Q}
$$

*(We solve for $N$ on the next slide.)*

## Deriving the concentration formula (II): Solution

**Introduce innovative potential** $\alpha = -\frac{dc(x)}{dx}\frac{x}{c}$ (from firm's R&D FOC).

**This implies:** $\frac{x}{cq} = \alpha$, so $\frac{Nx}{Q} = \frac{Nx}{Nq} = \frac{x}{q} = \alpha c$

**Substitute into our equation:**

$$
\underbrace{\frac{P}{N\varepsilon}}_{\text{markup}} = \underbrace{\alpha c}_{\text{R\&D cost per unit}}
$$

**Divide by $P$** and use $c/P = 1 - 1/(N\varepsilon)$ from the pricing FOC:

$$
\frac{1}{N\varepsilon} = \alpha\!\left(1 - \frac{1}{N\varepsilon}\right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{N^*} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\cdot\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}
$$

## Equilibrium concentration [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980]

**Equilibrium concentration satisfies:**

. . .

$$
\frac{1}{N^*} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \cdot \frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}
$$

::: {.callout-note title="Interpretation"}
Concentration and research intensity are jointly determined: entry expands $N$ until operating surplus covers R&D outlays $x^*$. Higher innovative potential ($\alpha$) supports higher concentration; more elastic demand lowers concentration.
:::

## Dasgupta–Stiglitz: numerical illustration

**Using the concentration formula** with specific values:

$$
\frac{1}{N^*} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \cdot \frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}
$$

- If $\varepsilon = 2$ and $\alpha = 1$: $\frac{1}{N^*} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$, so $N^* = 4$ firms
- If $\varepsilon = 2$ and $\alpha = 3$: $\frac{1}{N^*} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{8}$, so $N^* \approx 2.7$ firms

::: {.callout-note title="Discussion question"}
If a government subsidy increases innovative potential ($\alpha$), what does the model predict for market structure? Is this welfare-improving?
:::

## Dasgupta (1986): key comparative statics (I) [@dasguptaTheoryTechnologicalCompetition1986]

**With $P(Q) = \sigma Q^{-\varepsilon}$ and $c(x) = \beta x^{-\alpha}$:**

**Dynamic vs static efficiency trade-off:**

- $x^*(N+1) < x^*(N)$ (more firms → less R&D per firm)
- $Q^*(N+1) > Q^*(N)$ (more firms → higher output)

**Research intensity:**

- Often maximized at moderate concentration (Scherer-style inverse-U)

**Interpretation:**

- Market structure affects both static outcomes ($Q$) and dynamic investment incentives ($x$)

## Dasgupta (1986): key comparative statics (II) [@dasguptaTheoryTechnologicalCompetition1986]

**Greater innovative opportunities** associated with higher concentration:

$$
\frac{\partial (1/N^*)}{\partial \alpha} > 0
$$

**Demand growth stimulates R&D:**

$$
\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial \sigma} > 0
$$

**Interpretation:**

- Larger markets (higher $\sigma$) increase the return to cost reduction
- Stronger innovative opportunities (higher $\alpha$) can support higher concentration in equilibrium

## Summary and next week

**Summary**

- Innovation value depends on the objective: **$\Delta \pi$ (private)** versus **$\Delta W$ (social)**
- Replacement effect: pre-innovation rents reduce the incumbent's incremental gain from innovation
- With entry threat, innovation can be worth more because it changes **market structure** (monopoly vs duopoly)
- In oligopoly, incentives reflect competing forces (competition effect vs competitive advantage effect)

**Next week: patents and IPRs**

- Patents as incentives: monopoly rights vs. dynamic efficiency
- Patent races and timing
- Disclosure, licensing, and welfare
- Horizontal and vertical innovation (brief)
