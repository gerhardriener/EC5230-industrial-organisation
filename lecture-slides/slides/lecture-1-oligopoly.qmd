# Market Structures {background-color="#00539b"}

## Industrial Organisation: Overview

Economic models rest on key assumptions about market structure and firm behaviour.

**Under perfect competition:**

- Markets are efficient
- Price equals marginal cost

**Under imperfect competition:**

- Markets generate welfare losses
- Strategic firm behaviour matters


## Beyond Static Models

In reality, many markets feature:

- **Dynamic entry/exit:** Number of firms changes over time
- **Product differentiation:** Firms compete on product variety
- **Technological change:** Innovation and R&D investment
- **Demand shifts:** Advertising and marketing effects

$\rightarrow$ Static models provide a foundation, but IO studies these dynamic elements.

## Case: Alcoa as a Natural Monopoly {#alcoa-natural-monopoly}
::: {.callout-note}
Sources of market power in early aluminium production (c. 1886–1914).
:::

- **Patent advantage (1886):** Smelting process patented; only a small number of firms can produce at scale initially.

- **Economies of scale:** Alcoa expands output and develops downstream markets (intermediate and final aluminium products).

- **Input foreclosure (energy):** In 1893, Alcoa contracts in advance for hydroelectric power from Niagara Falls.

- **Input foreclosure (bauxite):** Alcoa secures major North American bauxite sources.

- **Dynamic efficiency and entry deterrence:** Cost reductions make entry difficult even after patent expiration.

- **Institutional environment:** Public policy, tariff protection, and limited antitrust enforcement before 1914.

## Market Structure Typology

Three key competitive regimes:

| Structure | # Firms | Price Setting | Output |
|-----------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Perfect Competition** | Many | Price-taker | Competitive |
| **Monopoly** | 1 | Monopolist | Restricted |
| **Cournot Oligopoly** | Few | Strategic | Intermediate |


## Cournot Quantity Competition

**Firm $i$'s maximisation problem:**

$$
\max_{q_i}\; q_i\left(P(q_i + q_{-i}) - c(q_i)\right)
$$

**Cournot Pricing Formula:**

$$
\frac{P - c'(q_i)}{P} = \frac{\alpha_i}{\eta}
$$

Where:

- $\alpha_i = \frac{q_i}{Q}$ is firm $i$'s market share
- $\eta = -\frac{dQ/Q}{dP/P}$ is the price elasticity of demand
- LHS is the Lerner index (mark-up rate)


## Cournot Pricing Formula: Interpretation

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Insight
The mark-up is directly proportional to market share and inversely related to demand elasticity.

- Larger market share → higher mark-up
- More elastic demand → lower mark-up
:::

This formula shows how market power arises from market concentration.


# Welfare Analysis {background-color="#00539b"}

## Welfare Measures in Equilibrium

Three welfare concepts:

- **Consumer Surplus (CS):** Benefit to buyers
- **Producer Surplus (PS):** Profit to firms
- **Welfare Loss (WL):** Deadweight loss from inefficiency


## Equilibrium Welfare Comparison

| Market Structure | Consumer Surplus | Producer Surplus | Welfare Loss |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Perfect Competition** | Max | 0 | 0 |
| **Monopoly** | Low | High | High |
| **Cournot Oligopoly** | Medium | Medium | Medium |

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Finding
Cournot oligopoly equilibrium is constrained efficient: it maximises neither consumer surplus nor aggregate surplus—the outcome reflects strategic interdependence without coordination.
:::


## Example: Three-Firm Market

**Setup:**

- Demand: $P = 20 - Q$
- Marginal costs: $c_1 = 0$, $c_2 = 5$, $c_3 = 7$

**Perfect Competition** (firm 1 at $p = MC = 0$):

- $\text{CS} = 200, \quad \text{PS} = 0, \quad \text{WL} = 0$

**Monopoly** (firm 1 alone):

- $\text{CS} = 50, \quad \text{PS} = 100, \quad \text{WL} = 50$

## Derivation of Cournot Triopoly

**Cournot Triopoly:**

- $\text{CS} = 72, \quad \text{PS} < 96, \quad \text{WL} > 32$

$\rightarrow$ Oligopoly equilibrium output lies strictly between monopoly and perfect competition; price and profits are correspondingly intermediate.


## Cournot Welfare Maximand

**Equilibrium maximises a weighted combination:**

$$
\max_Q \left\{ (n-1)\big[u(Q) - P(Q)Q\big] + n\big[P(Q)Q - nc(Q/n)\big] \right\}
$$

With $u'(Q) = P(Q)$ and $n$ identical firms.

**Interpretation:**

- Weight on PS is too high vs. social optimum (full competition)
- Weight on PS is too low vs. monopoly outcome (full collusion)

::: {.callout-note}
## Note
Oligopoly equilibrium reflects the tension between individual profit maximisation and the aggregate effect of firms’ choices on market price and quantity.
:::


## Welfare Weights Across Market Structures

**Recall the Cournot welfare maximand:**

$$
\max_Q \left\{ (n-1)\big[u(Q) - P(Q)Q\big] + n\big[P(Q)Q - nc(Q/n)\big] \right\}
$$

**Interpreting the weights $(n-1)$ and $n$ at extreme cases:**


### Perfect Competition: $n \to \infty$

$$\text{Weight on CS} = (n-1) \to \infty$$
$$\text{Weight on PS} = n \to \infty \quad \text{(but each firm gets } \pi_i = \tfrac{n \cdot \pi}{n} \approx 0\text{)}$$

**Result:** The welfare function places infinite weight on consumer surplus relative to individual firm profits. The equilibrium maximises CS subject to firms earning zero economic profit.

## Welfare Weights Across Market Structures
### Monopoly: $n = 1$

$$\text{Weight on CS} = (n-1) = 0$$
$$\text{Weight on PS} = n = 1$$

**Result:** The monopolist ignores consumer surplus entirely and maximises its own profit alone. The equilibrium is the unconstrained monopoly outcome.

## Welfare Weights Across Market Structures
### Cournot Oligopoly: $1 < n < \infty$

$$\text{Weight on CS} = (n-1) \in (0, \infty)$$
$$\text{Weight on PS} = n \in (1, \infty)$$

**Result:** Oligopoly equilibrium balances consumer and producer surplus with intermediate weights. The outcome reflects the tension between:

- Individual firm profit incentives (weight $n$)
- Aggregate demand response to total output (weight $n-1$)

::: {.callout-note}
## Interpretation
As $n$ increases from 1 to $\infty$, the weight on consumer surplus grows relative to producer surplus, driving equilibrium output toward the competitive level and price toward marginal cost.
:::

# Differentiated Products {background-color="#00539b"}

## Cournot vs. Bertrand: Strategic Variables Matter

**Core question:** Do firms compete on quantity or price?

| Model   | Strategic Variable | Best Response       | Competitiveness     |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Cournot | Quantity           | Downward-sloping    | Less competitive    |
| Bertrand| Price              | Upward-sloping      | More competitive    |

**Key insight:** The choice of strategic variable fundamentally affects market outcomes.


## Cournot with Differentiated Products

**Inverse demand functions:**

$$P_1 = a - bq_1 - dq_2$$
$$P_2 = a - dq_1 - bq_2$$

**Parameters:**

- $b > |d|$ (own effect > cross effect)
- $d \in (-b, b)$ measures product differentiation

**Interpretation of $d$:**

- $d < 0$: Goods are complements
- $d = 0$: Goods are independent
- $d > 0$: Goods are substitutes


## Cournot with Substitutes: Best Response

For substitute goods ($d > 0$):

$$
BR_i(q_j) = \frac{a - dq_j - c_i}{2b}
$$

**Key feature:** Downward-sloping best response

$\rightarrow$ Quantities are strategic substitutes

- If competitor increases output, my optimal response is to decrease output
- This dampening of quantities is characteristic of strategic substitutes


## Bertrand with Differentiated Products

**Demand functions:**

$$Q_1 = \tilde{a} - \tilde{b}p_1 + \tilde{d}p_2$$
$$Q_2 = \tilde{a} + \tilde{d}p_1 - \tilde{b}p_2$$

Parameters transform the problem:

- $\tilde{a} = \frac{a}{b+d}$
- $\tilde{b} = \frac{b}{b^2 - d^2}$
- $\tilde{d} = \frac{d}{b^2 - d^2}$

## Bertrand with Substitutes: Best Response

For substitute goods ($d > 0$):

$$
BR_i(p_j) = \frac{\tilde{a} + \tilde{d}p_j + \tilde{b}c_i}{2\tilde{b}}
$$

**Key feature:** Upward-sloping best response

$\rightarrow$ Prices are strategic complements

- If competitor raises price, my optimal response is to raise price
- This price complementarity reflects firms’ incentive to maintain price alignment


## Cournot vs. Bertrand: Equilibrium Prices

**Cournot equilibrium** ($c_i = 0$):

$$p_i^C = \frac{ab}{2b + d}$$

**Bertrand equilibrium** ($c_i = 0$):

$$p_i^B = \frac{a(b-d)}{2b - d}$$

**Price comparison:**

$$p_i^C - p_i^B = \frac{ad^2}{4b^2 - d^2} > 0$$

::: {.callout-note}
## Competition Intensity
Price competition (Bertrand) leads to lower prices and larger quantities than quantity competition (Cournot).

The strategic variable selection determines equilibrium price, output, and total welfare.

# Oligopoly Coordination {background-color="#00539b"}

## The Coordination Challenge

**Can competing firms coordinate pricing without explicit contracts?**

**Obstacles:**

- Individual profit motives conflict with group interest (monopoly profit)
- No legal mechanism to enforce agreements
- Constant temptation to cheat on “deals”

**Result:** The non-cooperative (Nash) equilibrium is Pareto-dominated by coordinated outcomes.


## Facilitating Devices

Firms use **facilitating devices** to overcome coordination problems:

- **Increase incentives to cooperate** — benefit from higher prices
- **Decrease incentives to cheat** — punishment for deviation

**Legal examples:**

- Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clauses
- Most-Favoured-Customer (MFC) clauses

::: {.callout-warning}
## Policy Scrutiny
These devices alter payoff structures in ways that enable tacit collusion; competition authorities scrutinise them accordingly.
:::

## The Prisoner’s Dilemma: Setup

**Two firms, one period. Payoff matrix:**

|      | High Price | Low Price |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **High Price** | 100, 100 | -10, 140 |
| **Low Price**  | 140, -10 | 70, 70   |

**Nash equilibrium:** $(p_L, p_L)$ with payoffs $70,\, 70$

**Cooperative outcome:** $(p_H, p_H)$ with payoffs $100,\, 100$

**Problem:** Cooperation is not a Nash equilibrium without commitment or repeated-game structure.


## Why Coordination Fails: Incentive Incompatibility

Starting from $(p_L, p_L)$, why cannot both firms coordinate on $(p_H, p_H)$?

**Sequential move problem:**

1. **First-mover disadvantage:** Leader gets payoff $-10$ while follower earns $140$
2. **Incentive to delay:** Follower waits to capture the $140$
3. **Leader’s temptation to revert:** Seeing no response, leader drops back to $p_L$

::: {.callout-important}
## Coordination Failure
Unilateral deviation is profitable from any proposed high-price agreement; hence the prisoner’s dilemma equilibrium is the unique Nash equilibrium of the simultaneous-move game.
:::


## Solving Coordination: The Adjusted Payoff Matrix

**Reduce follower’s transitional gain:**

|      | High Price | Low Price |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **High Price** | 100, 100 | -10, 90 |
| **Low Price**  | 90, -10  | 70, 70  |

**Then $(p_H, p_H)$ is a Nash equilibrium in the single-period game.**

**Equilibrium characterisation:**

- If firm moves to $p_H$, it earns $-10$ in the transition
- Given the opponent is at $p_H$, best response is also $p_H$, earning $100$
- Both firms converge to $(p_H, p_H)$ with payoffs 100, 100 (symmetric equilibrium)


## Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Clause Explained

**What is an MFN clause?**

A seller commits to:

- Charge a specified minimum price
- Refund buyers if a lower price is offered later
- Pay penalties equivalent to price differences

**Effect:**

| Action | Without MFN        | With MFN                      |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Price cut benefit | Capture all new buyers | Lose many to refunds         |
| Price cut cost    | Minimal               | Refund obligations + penalties |

$\rightarrow$ MFN raises the cost of deviation from high price.


## MFN as Self-Enforcement

**For MFN to work, it must be self-enforcing:**

$$
\text{Gross profit from deviation} - \text{Refunds} < \text{Profit under MFN}
$$

**Example:**

- Gross profit gain from cutting price: $0.897$
- Refunds owed to existing customers: $0.056$
- Net gain: $0.841$ (which is less than staying at MFN price)

$\rightarrow$ Deviation becomes unprofitable.

::: {.callout-note}
## Free Rider Effect in Reverse (Salop 1985)
Individual buyers value MFN protection, but collectively it harms them by preventing sellers from offering discounts to future customers.
:::


## Numerical Example: Setup

**Bertrand duopoly with differentiated products:**

Demand:

$$Q_1 = 3 - 2p_1 + p_2$$
$$Q_2 = 3 + p_1 - 2p_2$$

Costs: $c_1 = c_2 = 1$


## Baseline Bertrand Equilibrium

**Best response functions:**

$$
BR_i(p_j) = \frac{5 + p_j}{4}
$$

**Equilibrium:**

- $p_1^B = p_2^B = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.667$
- $\pi_i^B = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.889$

**Question:** Can Firm 1 increase profits by adopting an MFN clause?


## Firm 1 Adopts MFN Clause

**Firm 1 commits to price $p_1^* = \frac{12}{7} \approx 1.714$**

**Firm 2’s best response:**

$$
p_2^* = BR_2(p_1^*) = \frac{47}{28} \approx 1.678
$$

**Outcomes:**

- $Q_1^* = \frac{5}{4}$
- $\pi_1^* = \frac{25}{28} \approx 0.893 > 0.889$

::: {.callout-note}
Firm 1’s profits rise to $\approx 0.893$ from the Bertrand equilibrium level of $0.889$ by committing to a higher price via the MFN clause.
:::


## Can Firm 1 Deviate from MFN?

**Firm 1 considers deviating to $\tilde{p}_1 = BR_1(p_2^*) = \frac{187}{112} \approx 1.669$**

**Gross profit from deviation:**

- $\tilde{Q}_1 = \frac{75}{56}$
- $\tilde{\pi}_1 = \frac{5625}{6272} \approx 0.897$

**But MFN requires refunds:**

$$
\text{Refunds} = Q_1^* (p_1^* - \tilde{p}_1) = \frac{25}{448} \approx 0.056
$$

**Net profit after refunds:**

$$
\tilde{\pi}_1 - \text{Refunds} = \frac{5275}{6272} \approx 0.841
$$

::: {.callout-important}
Net profit from deviation ($0.841$) is strictly less than profit under MFN commitment ($0.893$). The MFN clause is thus self-enforcing: no firm has incentive to deviate unilaterally.
:::


## MFN Exercise

**What if Firm 1 commits to an even higher MFN price of $p_1^* = 2$?**

Calculate:

- Firm 2’s best response: $p_2^* = BR_2(2) = ?$
- Firm 1’s quantity: $Q_1^* = ?$
- Firm 1’s profit: $\pi_1^* = ?$

**Discussion:**

- Does the higher MFN price further increase Firm 1’s profits?
- At what price do incentives to deviate become compelling?
- Can the MFN clause be too restrictive?


## Summary: Oligopoly Coordination

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Coordination problem:** Joint profit maximisation yields higher payoffs than Nash equilibrium, but the cooperative outcome is not self-enforcing in simultaneous-move games
2. **Single-period dilemma:** The Nash equilibrium is Pareto-inefficient
3. **Facilitating devices:** MFN clauses alter the payoff structure to align individual and collective incentives
4. **Self-enforcement:** Properly structured MFN clauses render deviation less profitable than compliance, inducing equilibrium behaviour
