## Differentiation types

- Horizontal: consumers disagree on which variety is best (ideal-point / mismatch preferences)
- Vertical: products differ in quality; at equal prices all consumers (weakly) prefer the higher-quality good

**Today: roadmap**

- Focus: horizontal differentiation
- Hotelling line: 2 firms, pricing with fixed locations
- Salop circular city: free entry and welfare

# Hotelling Model

## Setup: Fixed locations, price competition
