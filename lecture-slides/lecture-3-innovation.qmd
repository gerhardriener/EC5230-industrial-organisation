# Innovation and Market Structure {background-color="#00539b"}


## Innovation: types and stages

**Why study innovation?**

- Innovation is a **stochastic** process
- **Probability of success** depends on resources allocated

**Types:**

- **Process innovation**: shifts cost function (typically lowers marginal cost)
- **Product innovation**: shifts demand function

**Stages:**

- Research → Development → Adoption

## Innovation and competition: two-way relation

**Two-way relationship:**

- How **market structure** affects incentives to innovate
- How **innovation** affects market structure

**Key question:**

- Compare maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for innovation across market structures:
  1. Monopoly (before and after innovation)
  2. Perfect competition (before; monopoly rights after)
  3. Social planner

**Interpretation**: Max WTP = increase in profit (firm) or welfare (planner) from acquiring innovation

# Market Structure and Innovation Incentives {background-color="#00539b"}

## Example: linear demand and process innovation

**Market demand (inverse):**

$$
P(Q) = A - Q
$$

**Process innovation:**

- Marginal cost falls from $c_0$ to $c_1$ where $c_1 < c_0 < A$

**Variables:**

- $A$ = demand intercept (parameter)
- $Q$ = total quantity (endogenous)
- $c_0, c_1$ = marginal costs before/after innovation (parameters)

## Monopoly (before and after innovation)

**Monopoly problem:**

$$
\max_Q \ (A - Q - c)Q
$$

**First-order condition:**

$$
A - 2Q - c = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q^m(c) = \frac{A-c}{2}
$$

**Equilibrium outcomes:**

- Price: $P^m(c) = \frac{A+c}{2}$
- Profit: $\pi^m(c) = \frac{(A-c)^2}{4}$

**Max WTP for innovation:**

$$
\Delta \pi^m = \pi^m(c_1) - \pi^m(c_0) = \frac{(A-c_1)^2 - (A-c_0)^2}{4}
$$

## Perfect competition (before; monopoly rights after)

**Before innovation (all firms at MC $c_0$):**

- Competitive price: $P^{pc}_0 = c_0$
- Firm profit: $\pi = 0$

**After innovation (innovator has exclusive use):**

- If innovation is **drastic**: innovator behaves as monopolist at cost $c_1$
- If **non-drastic**: innovator constrained by competitive fringe at $c_0$

**Key insight:**

- Competitive firm can be willing to pay **more** than monopolist
- Creates profit rather than replacing existing profit

## Size of process innovation: drastic v non-drastic

**Definitions:**

- **Drastic (major) innovation**: innovator behaves as unconstrained monopolist
- **Non-drastic (minor) innovation**: innovator has cost advantage but remains constrained by rivals

**Criterion:**

Innovation is drastic if monopoly price at cost $c_1$ falls below rivals' cost $c_0$:

$$
P^m(c_1) < c_0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \frac{A+c_1}{2} < c_0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad A + c_1 < 2c_0
$$

**Interpretation**: Large enough cost reduction makes entry unprofitable even at zero markup

## Replacement effect (Arrow 1962)

**Key result:**

- **Monopolist** has positive pre-innovation profits → innovation partly **replaces** existing profits
- **Competitive firm** earns (near) zero pre-innovation profits → innovation **creates** new profits

**Implication:**

- Competitive firm may be willing to pay more than monopolist for same innovation
- Pre-existing market power reduces innovation incentives (ceteris paribus)

**Caveat**: Depends on whether monopolist faces entry threat

## Social planner: welfare maximization

**Efficient output** for demand $P(Q)=A-Q$ and marginal cost $c$:

$$
P(Q) = c \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q^{sp}(c) = A - c
$$

**Total surplus (welfare):**

$$
W(c) = \int_0^{A-c} (A - Q - c) \, dQ = \frac{(A-c)^2}{2}
$$

**Max WTP for innovation (social planner):**

$$
\Delta W = W(c_1) - W(c_0) = \frac{(A-c_1)^2 - (A-c_0)^2}{2}
$$

**Comparison**: Social planner values innovation most (maximizes total surplus)

## Exercise: Bertrand with process innovation

**Market:**

- Inverse demand: $P(Q) = 15 - Q$
- Bertrand competition
- Process innovation lowers MC from $c_0 = 3$ to $c_1 = 0$

**Compare two market structures:**

- Monopoly (before and after innovation)
- Perfect competition (before; monopoly rights after innovation)

**Tasks:**

1. Compute max WTP for innovation in each case
2. Compute change in total welfare (PS + CS) from innovation
3. Compare innovation incentives across structures

# Oligopoly and Innovation {background-color="#00539b"}

## Incentives to innovate in oligopoly

**Earlier ranking (under specific assumptions):**

- Max WTP: **Social planner > Competitive firm > Monopoly**

**But in oligopoly:**

- Incentives need not be monotone in competition intensity
- Key drivers:
  - Number of firms ($n$)
  - Product differentiation
  - Type of competition (price vs quantity)

## Impact of number of firms (Cournot intuition)

**Linear Cournot with $n$ firms:**

- Innovation incentives can follow **inverse-U** as $n$ increases

**Two opposing effects as $n \uparrow$:**

- **Competition effect**: profits for all firms fall (discourages innovation)
- **Competitive advantage effect**: cost advantage becomes more valuable when there are more inefficient rivals (encourages innovation)

**Result**: Moderate concentration may maximize innovation incentives

## Monopoly threatened by entry: setup

**Incumbent monopoly faces potential entrant:**

- Both can acquire innovation reducing MC from $c_0$ to $c_1 < c_0$
- Entrant can enter profitably **only if** it gets innovation

**Payoffs:**

- **If incumbent gets innovation**: entrant stays out
  - Incumbent: $\pi^m(c_1)$; Entrant: $0$
- **If entrant gets innovation**: entrant enters
  - Incumbent: $\pi^d(c_0, c_1)$; Entrant: $\pi^d(c_1, c_0)$

## Efficiency effect (Gilbert & Newbery 1982)

**Per-period value of innovation:**

$$
V_I = \pi^m(c_1) - \pi^d(c_0, c_1)
$$

$$
V_E = \pi^d(c_1, c_0) - 0
$$

**Incumbent has higher incentives if:**

$$
V_I > V_E \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \pi^m(c_1) > \pi^d(c_1, c_0) + \pi^d(c_0, c_1)
$$

**Holds typically when** products are close substitutes

**Interpretation**: Fear of losing monopoly position strengthens incumbent's incentive; innovation may **prolong monopoly**

# Seminal Contributions {background-color="#00539b"}

## Dasgupta & Stiglitz (1980): setup

**Question**: Does more firms imply more innovation?

**Primitives:**

- $U(Q)$ = gross social benefit
- $c = c(x)$ = constant marginal cost depending on R&D expenditure $x$
- Assumption: $c'(x) < 0$ (R&D reduces cost)

**Social optimum:**

$$
\max_{x,Q} \ V(x,Q) = U(Q) - c(x)Q - x
$$

**First-order condition in $x$:**

$$
-c'(x)Q = 1
$$

## Dasgupta & Stiglitz (1980): firm problem

**Firm $i$'s problem (symmetric firms):**

$$
\max_{x_i, q_i} \ \pi(x_i, q_i) = [P(q_i + q_{-i}) - c(x_i)]q_i - x_i
$$

**Symmetric equilibrium:**

- $q_1^* = \cdots = q_N^* = Q^*/N$ and $x_1^* = \cdots = x_N^* = x^*$

**First-order condition in $q_i$:**

$$
P(Q^*)\left(1 - \frac{\varepsilon}{N}\right) = c(x^*)
$$

where $\varepsilon = -\frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\frac{P}{Q}$ is demand elasticity

## Dasgupta & Stiglitz (1980): free entry

**Zero profit condition** (free entry):

$$
\pi = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (P - c)\frac{Q^*}{N^*} - x^* = 0
$$

**Rearrange:**

$$
P - c = N^* \frac{x^*}{Q^*}
$$

**Key implication**: Concentration and research intensity are **jointly determined** (no simple causal link)

## Dasgupta & Stiglitz (1980): equilibrium concentration

**Define innovative potential:**

$$
\alpha = -\frac{dc(x)}{dx}\frac{x}{c}
$$

**Equilibrium concentration satisfies:**

$$
\frac{1}{N^*} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \cdot \frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}
$$

**Interpretation:**

- Higher $\alpha$ (greater innovative potential) → higher concentration
- More elastic demand → lower concentration

## Dasgupta (1986): additional results (part 1)

**With $P(Q) = \sigma Q^{-\varepsilon}$ and $c(x) = \beta x^{-\alpha}$:**

**Dynamic vs static efficiency trade-off:**

- $x^*(N+1) < x^*(N)$ (more firms → less R&D per firm)
- $Q^*(N+1) > Q^*(N)$ (more firms → higher output)

**Research intensity:**

- Often maximized at moderate concentration (Scherer-style inverse-U)

## Dasgupta (1986): additional results (part 2)

**Greater innovative opportunities** associated with higher concentration:

$$
\frac{\partial (1/N^*)}{\partial \alpha} > 0
$$

**Demand growth stimulates R&D:**

$$
\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial \sigma} > 0
$$

**Interpretation**: Larger markets justify higher fixed R&D investments
