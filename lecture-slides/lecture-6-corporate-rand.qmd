# Cooperative R&D {background-color="#00539b"}

## Cooperative R&D: overview

::: {.callout-note}
## Object of analysis

R&D cooperation when R&D creates spillovers ($\beta>0$) or allows cost sharing (RJV).
:::

- Baseline: each firm chooses R&D privately and internalises only its own costs/benefits

- This lecture:
  - R&D spillovers and the incentive to coordinate R&D
  - Research joint ventures (RJVs) as cost-sharing arrangements

- Core question:
  - When does cooperation increase welfare relative to non-cooperative R&D?

## Multi-stage games: reminder

- Two-stage structure:
  1. Stage 1: choose $x_i$ (R&D)
  2. Stage 2: choose $q_i$ (product-market competition)

::: {.callout-important}
## Backward induction

Solve Stage 2 for $q_i^*(x)$, substitute into Stage 1 payoffs, then solve for $x^*$.

# R&D spillovers (d’Aspremont–Jacquemin) {background-color="#00539b"}

## Spillovers model: primitives

- Duopoly with inverse demand:

$$
p(Q) = A - Q,\quad Q=q_1+q_2
$$

- Cost and spillovers:
  - Marginal cost of firm $i$: $c_i = c - x_i - \beta x_j$ with $\beta\in(0,1)$
  - Feasibility: $x_i + \beta x_j \le c$

- R&D cost:
  - Firm $i$ pays $\frac{x_i^2}{2}$

- Objects:
  - Choice variables: $x_i$ (stage 1), $q_i$ (stage 2)
  - Parameters: $A, c, \beta$

::: {.callout-note}
## Spillover parameter

$\beta\in(0,1)$ measures how much of firm $j$'s R&D reduces firm $i$'s marginal cost.
:::

## Spillovers model: stage-2 profit

- Given $(x_1,x_2)$, firm $i$ chooses $q_i$ to maximise:

$$
\pi_i(q_i;q_j,x_i,x_j)=[A-(q_i+q_j)-c_i]q_i-\frac{x_i^2}{2}
$$

- Interpretation:
  - R&D shifts marginal cost; output competition determines how much cost reduction is monetised

## Product-market equilibrium (Cournot): quantities

- Cournot–Nash equilibrium quantities (given $x_1,x_2$):

$$
q_i^*=\frac{1}{3}\Big[(A-c)+(2-\beta)x_i+(2\beta-1)x_j\Big]
$$

- Interpretation:
  - Own R&D raises own output; rival R&D can raise or lower own output depending on spillover strength

::: {.callout-note}
## Strategic effect of spillovers

The term $(2\beta-1)x_j$ implies rival R&D can be output-increasing or output-reducing depending on whether $\beta$ is above or below $\tfrac{1}{2}$.
:::

# R&D regimes {background-color="#00539b"}

## Regimes: definition

- We compare three institutional regimes:

- Game I:
  - Non-cooperative R&D and non-cooperative output (Cournot)

- Game II:
  - Cooperative R&D, non-cooperative output (Cournot)

- Game III:
  - Cooperative R&D and cooperative output (joint profit maximisation)

## Game I: stage-1 problem (non-cooperative R&D)

- Stage 1 objective for firm $i$:

$$
\max_{x_i}\ \pi_i^*(x_i,x_j)=[q_i^*(x_i,x_j)]^2-\frac{x_i^2}{2}
$$

- Symmetric equilibrium ($x_1=x_2=x^*$):

$$
x^*=\frac{(A-c)(2-\beta)}{4.5-(2-\beta)(1+\beta)}
$$

- Interpretation:
  - Each firm invests less when spillovers are high because part of the benefit accrues to the rival

## Game II: stage-1 problem (cooperative R&D)

- Firms choose $(x_1,x_2)$ to maximise joint profit given Cournot output:

$$
\max_{x_1,x_2}\ \hat{\pi}=\pi_1^*+\pi_2^*
$$

- Symmetric solution ($x_1=x_2=\hat{x}$):

$$
\hat{x}=\frac{(A-c)(1+\beta)}{4.5-(1+\beta)^2}
$$

- Interpretation:
  - Internalising spillovers increases R&D relative to Game I (for intermediate $\beta$)

## Game III: cooperative R&D and output

- With full cooperation, firms maximise joint profit over $(q_1,q_2,x_1,x_2)$

- Under symmetry ($x_1=x_2=x$, $q_1=q_2$), aggregate output in stage 2 is:

$$
\tilde{Q}=\frac{(A-c)+(1+\beta)x}{2}
$$

- Stage 1 chooses $x$ to maximise joint profit; solution:

$$
\tilde{x}=\frac{(A-c)(1+\beta)}{4-(1+\beta)^2}
$$

- Interpretation:
  - Output coordination reduces product-market competition; R&D incentives differ because they are evaluated at monopoly output

# Welfare {background-color="#00539b"}

## Welfare benchmark: social planner

Assume symmetry $x_1=x_2=x$.

- Welfare function (as stated in the lecture):

$$
W(Q)=V(Q)+R(Q)-[c-(1+\beta)x]Q-x^2
$$

- Stage 2 FOC w.r.t. $Q$:

$$
Q=A-c+(1+\beta)x
$$

- Interpretation:
  - Planner expands output to the efficient level given the cost reduction from total effective R&D

## Social optimum: R&D and output

- Socially optimal R&D:

$$
x^{**}=\frac{(A-c)(1+\beta)}{2-(1+\beta)^2}
$$

- Socially optimal output:

$$
Q^{**}=(A-c)\left[\frac{2}{2-(1+\beta)^2}\right]
$$

- Interpretation:
  - Relative to market outcomes, the planner internalises both spillovers and the consumer-surplus gain from lower prices

## Comparing regimes: R&D and output rankings

- R&D expenditure comparison (from the lecture):
  - Large spillovers: $x^{**}>\tilde{x}>\hat{x}>x^*$
  - Small spillovers: $x^{**}>\tilde{x}\ge x^*>\hat{x}$

- Output comparison (from the lecture):
  - Large spillovers: $Q^{**}>\hat{Q}>Q^*>\tilde{Q}$
  - Small spillovers: $Q^{**}>Q^*>\hat{Q}>\tilde{Q}$

::: {.callout-important}
## Reading the rankings

Higher $x$ need not imply higher $Q$ when cooperation also changes the intensity of product-market competition.

# Research joint ventures (Combs) {background-color="#00539b"}

## RJV model: primitives

- Probability a single lab succeeds: $p$
- Product-market profits:
  - Monopoly: $\pi^m$
  - Duopoly: $\pi^d$
- Fixed cost of a lab: $F$

- Assumptions:
  - If both succeed, firms compete in the product market (profits $\pi^d$ each)
  - If only one succeeds (non-cooperative setting), the innovator earns $\pi^m$

## RJV: cost-sharing (single lab)

- Each cooperating firm’s expected payoff:

$$
V_C=p\pi^d-\frac{F}{2}
$$

- Non-cooperating firm’s expected payoff:

$$
V_N=p(1-p)\pi^m+p^2\pi^d-F
$$

- Cooperation condition:

$$
V_C\ge V_N \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \frac{F}{2}\ge p(1-p)(\pi^m-\pi^d)
$$

- Interpretation:
  - Cooperation is more attractive when the “winner-takes-all” component $p(1-p)$ is small

## RJV: duplication (two labs)

- If the RJV runs two labs (duplication), payoff of each cooperating firm:

$$
\tilde{V}_C=2p\pi^d-F
$$

- Non-cooperating payoff remains $V_N$

- Cooperation condition:

$$
\tilde{V}_C\ge \tilde{V}_N \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad p\ge \frac{\pi^m-2\pi^d}{\pi^m-\pi^d}\equiv K
$$

- Interpretation:
  - With duplication, cooperation depends mainly on success probability $p$ (not on $F$)

## Summary & references

**Summary**

- Spillovers $\beta>0$ create an externality in R&D, so non-cooperative R&D can be inefficiently low
- Cooperative R&D internalises spillovers and can increase R&D relative to non-cooperative choices
- Full cooperation may reduce product-market competition, affecting output and welfare
- RJVs trade off cost sharing against strategic effects from duplication and winning probabilities
