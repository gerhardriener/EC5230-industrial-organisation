# Part I. Market Structures {background-color="#00539b"}

## Perfect Competition Benchmark

**Under perfect competition:**

- Price equals marginal cost: $P = MC$
- Markets are allocatively efficient
- Zero economic profit in long run
- Homogeneous products
- Many buyers and sellers



## Imperfect Competition: Strategic Behavior

**Under imperfect competition:**

- Price exceeds marginal cost: $P > MC$
- Markets generate welfare losses
- Strategic firm behavior matters
- Product differentiation possible
- Few firms with market power


# Market Structures {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Market Structure Typology

Three key competitive regimes:

| Structure | # Firms | Price Setting | Output |
|-----------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Perfect Competition** | Many | Price-taker | Competitive |
| **Monopoly** | 1 | Demand curve | Lower |
| **Cournot Oligopoly** | Few | Strategic | Intermediate |


## Cournot Quantity Competition: Model

**Firm $i$'s maximization problem:**

$$\max_{q_i} \left[q_i \left(P(q_i + q_{-i}) - c(q_i)\right)\right]$$

**Variables:**
- $q_i$: firm $i$'s quantity (choice variable)
- $q_{-i}$: rivals' total quantity (parameter from firm $i$'s perspective)
- $P(\cdot)$: inverse demand function (parameter)
- $c(\cdot)$: cost function (parameter)


## Cournot Pricing Formula

**Equilibrium condition:**

$$\frac{P - c'(q_i)}{P} = \frac{\alpha_i}{\eta}$$

**Where:**
- $\alpha_i = \frac{q_i}{Q}$ is firm $i$'s market share
- $\eta = -\frac{dQ/Q}{dP/P}$ is the price elasticity of demand
- LHS is the Lerner index (mark-up rate)

---

## Cournot Pricing Formula: Interpretation

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Insight
The mark-up is directly proportional to market share and inversely related to demand elasticity.

- Larger market share → higher mark-up
- More elastic demand → lower mark-up
:::

# Welfare Analysis {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Welfare Measures in Equilibrium

**Three welfare concepts:**

- **Consumer Surplus (CS):** $u(Q) - P(Q)Q$
- **Producer Surplus (PS):** $P(Q)Q - C(Q)$
- **Welfare Loss (WL):** Deadweight loss from inefficiency

All measured relative to competitive benchmark.

---

## Welfare Comparison Across Market Structures

| Market Structure | Consumer Surplus | Producer Surplus | Welfare Loss |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Perfect Competition** | Max | 0 | 0 |
| **Monopoly** | Low | Max | High |
| **Cournot Oligopoly** | Intermediate | Intermediate | Intermediate |

---

## Cournot Efficiency: Interpretation

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Finding
Cournot oligopoly equilibrium is constrained efficient: it maximizes a weighted combination of consumer and producer surplus—the outcome reflects strategic interdependence without coordination.
:::

**Implication:** Oligopoly output lies strictly between monopoly and perfect competition.

---

## Three-Firm Market: Setup

**Parameters:**

- Demand: $P = 20 - Q$
- Marginal costs: $c_1 = 0$, $c_2 = 5$, $c_3 = 7$

---

## Three-Firm Market: Perfect Competition vs. Monopoly

**Perfect Competition** (firm 1 at $p = MC = 0$):

$$\text{CS} = 200, \quad \text{PS} = 0, \quad \text{WL} = 0$$

**Monopoly** (firm 1 alone):

$$\text{CS} = 50, \quad \text{PS} = 100, \quad \text{WL} = 50$$

---

## Three-Firm Market: Cournot Triopoly

**Cournot Triopoly:**

$$\text{CS} = 72, \quad \text{PS} < 96, \quad \text{WL} > 32$$

**Result:** Oligopoly equilibrium output lies strictly between monopoly and perfect competition; price and profits are correspondingly intermediate.

---

## Cournot Welfare Maximand

**Equilibrium maximizes a weighted combination:**

$$
\max_Q \left\{ (n-1)[u(Q) - P(Q)Q] + n[P(Q)Q - nc(Q/n)] \right\}
$$

**Components:**
- $(n-1)[u(Q) - P(Q)Q]$: weight on consumer surplus
- $n[P(Q)Q - nc(Q/n)]$: weight on producer surplus
- $n$ identical firms, $u'(Q) = P(Q)$

---

## Welfare Weights: Perfect Competition

**As $n \to \infty$:**

$$\text{Weight on CS} = (n-1) \to \infty$$
$$\text{Weight on PS} = n \to \infty$$

---

## Perfect Competition: Interpretation

**Result:** The welfare function places infinite weight on consumer surplus relative to individual firm profits. 

**Equilibrium:** Maximizes CS subject to firms earning zero economic profit.

---

## Welfare Weights: Monopoly

**When $n = 1$:**

$$\text{Weight on CS} = (n-1) = 0$$
$$\text{Weight on PS} = n = 1$$

---

## Monopoly: Interpretation

**Result:** The monopolist ignores consumer surplus entirely and maximizes its own profit alone. 

**Equilibrium:** Unconstrained monopoly outcome.

---

## Welfare Weights: Cournot Oligopoly

**When $1 < n < \infty$:**

$$\text{Weight on CS} = (n-1) \in (0, \infty)$$
$$\text{Weight on PS} = n \in (1, \infty)$$

---

## Cournot Oligopoly: Interpretation

**Result:** Oligopoly equilibrium balances consumer and producer surplus with intermediate weights.

**The outcome reflects tension between:**
- Individual firm profit incentives (weight $n$)
- Aggregate demand response to total output (weight $n-1$)

---

## Welfare Weights: Comparative Statics

::: {.callout-note}
## Convergence to Competition
As $n$ increases from 1 to $\infty$, the weight on consumer surplus grows relative to producer surplus, driving equilibrium output toward the competitive level and price toward marginal cost.

# Differentiated Products {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Cournot Model with Differentiated Products

**Inverse demand functions:**

$$P_1 = a - bq_1 - dq_2$$
$$P_2 = a - dq_1 - bq_2$$

**Parameters:**
- $b > |d|$ (own effect > cross effect)
- $d \in (-b, b)$ measures product differentiation

---

## Product Differentiation Parameter: Interpretation

**Interpretation of $d$:**

- $d < 0$: Goods are complements
- $d = 0$: Goods are independent
- $d > 0$: Goods are substitutes

---

## Cournot Best Response with Substitutes

**For substitute goods ($d > 0$):**

$$BR_i(q_j) = \frac{a - dq_j - c_i}{2b}$$

**Property:** Downward-sloping best response.

---

## Strategic Substitutes: Interpretation

**Quantities are strategic substitutes:**

If competitor increases output, my optimal response is to decrease output.

**Economic mechanism:** Output expansion by rival reduces residual demand; optimal response is to contract.

---

## Bertrand Model with Differentiated Products

**Demand functions:**

$$Q_1 = \tilde{a} - \tilde{b}p_1 + \tilde{d}p_2$$
$$Q_2 = \tilde{a} + \tilde{d}p_1 - \tilde{b}p_2$$

**Transformed parameters:**
- $\tilde{a} = \frac{a}{b+d}$
- $\tilde{b} = \frac{b}{b^2 - d^2}$
- $\tilde{d} = \frac{d}{b^2 - d^2}$

---

## Bertrand Best Response with Substitutes

**For substitute goods ($d > 0$):**

$$BR_i(p_j) = \frac{\tilde{a} + \tilde{d}p_j + \tilde{b}c_i}{2\tilde{b}}$$

**Property:** Upward-sloping best response.

---

## Strategic Complements: Interpretation

**Prices are strategic complements:**

If competitor raises price, my optimal response is to raise price.

**Economic mechanism:** Price increase by rival softens competition; optimal response is to maintain price alignment.

---

## Equilibrium Prices: Cournot vs. Bertrand

**Cournot equilibrium** ($c_i = 0$):

$$p_i^C = \frac{ab}{2b + d}$$

**Bertrand equilibrium** ($c_i = 0$):

$$p_i^B = \frac{a(b-d)}{2b - d}$$

---

## Price Comparison: Cournot vs. Bertrand

**Price difference:**

$$p_i^C - p_i^B = \frac{ad^2}{4b^2 - d^2} > 0$$

**Result:** Bertrand prices are strictly lower than Cournot prices.

---

## Competition Intensity: Interpretation

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Finding
Price competition (Bertrand) leads to lower prices and larger quantities than quantity competition (Cournot).

The strategic variable selection determines equilibrium price, output, and total welfare.

# Oligopoly Coordination {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Tacit Collusion Problem

**Can competing firms coordinate pricing without explicit contracts?**

**Obstacles:**
- Individual profit motives conflict with group interest
- No legal mechanism to enforce agreements
- Constant temptation to cheat on agreements

---

## Coordination Failure in Oligopoly

**Result:** The non-cooperative (Nash) equilibrium is Pareto-dominated by coordinated outcomes.

**Implication:** Firms would jointly profit from coordination but cannot achieve it without commitment devices.

---

## Facilitating Devices: Definition

**Facilitating devices** are contractual mechanisms that:

- Increase incentives to cooperate
- Decrease incentives to cheat

**Legal examples:**
- Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clauses
- Most-Favoured-Customer (MFC) clauses

---

## Facilitating Devices: Competition Policy

::: {.callout-warning}
## Policy Scrutiny
These devices alter payoff structures in ways that enable tacit collusion; competition authorities scrutinize them accordingly.
:::

---

## The Prisoner's Dilemma: Payoff Matrix

**Two firms, one period:**

|      | High Price | Low Price |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **High Price** | 100, 100 | -10, 140 |
| **Low Price** | 140, -10 | 70, 70 |

---

## Prisoner's Dilemma: Nash Equilibrium

**Nash equilibrium:** $(p_L, p_L)$ with payoffs 70, 70

**Cooperative outcome:** $(p_H, p_H)$ with payoffs 100, 100

**Problem:** Cooperation is not a Nash equilibrium without commitment or repeated-game structure.

---

## Incentive Incompatibility: Sequential Logic

**Starting from $(p_L, p_L)$, why cannot both firms coordinate on $(p_H, p_H)$?**

1. **First-mover disadvantage:** Leader gets payoff $-10$ while follower earns $140$
2. **Incentive to delay:** Follower waits to capture the $140$
3. **Leader's temptation to revert:** Seeing no response, leader drops back to $p_L$

---

## Coordination Failure: Equilibrium Characterization

::: {.callout-important}
## Unique Nash Equilibrium
Unilateral deviation is profitable from any proposed high-price agreement; hence the prisoner's dilemma equilibrium $(p_L, p_L)$ is the unique Nash equilibrium of the simultaneous-move game.
:::

---

## Adjusted Payoff Matrix: Coordination Solution

**Reduce follower's transitional gain:**

|      | High Price | Low Price |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **High Price** | 100, 100 | -10, 90 |
| **Low Price** | 90, -10 | 70, 70 |

**Result:** $(p_H, p_H)$ is now a Nash equilibrium.

---

## Adjusted Equilibrium: Interpretation

**If firm moves to $p_H$:**
- Earns $-10$ in the transition
- Given opponent is at $p_H$, best response is also $p_H$, earning $100$

**Both firms converge to $(p_H, p_H)$ with payoffs 100, 100** (symmetric equilibrium).

---

## Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Clause

**Definition:**

A seller commits to:
- Charge a specified minimum price
- Refund buyers if a lower price is offered later
- Pay penalties equivalent to price differences

---

## MFN Effect on Deviation Incentives

**Effect on deviation cost:**

| Action | Without MFN | With MFN |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Price cut benefit** | Capture all new buyers | Lose many to refunds |
| **Price cut cost** | Minimal | Refund obligations + penalties |

**Result:** MFN raises the cost of deviation from high price.

---

## MFN Self-Enforcement Condition

**For MFN to work, it must be self-enforcing:**

$$\text{Gross profit from deviation} - \text{Refunds} < \text{Profit under MFN}$$

**Implication:** Deviation becomes unprofitable.

---

## MFN Welfare Effect

::: {.callout-note}
## Free Rider Effect in Reverse (Salop 1986)
Individual buyers value MFN protection, but collectively it harms them by preventing sellers from offering discounts to future customers.
:::

---

## Numerical Example: Bertrand Duopoly Setup

**Model:**

Demand:
$$Q_1 = 3 - 2p_1 + p_2$$
$$Q_2 = 3 + p_1 - 2p_2$$

Costs: $c_1 = c_2 = 1$

---

## Baseline Bertrand Equilibrium

**Best response functions:**

$$BR_i(p_j) = \frac{5 + p_j}{4}$$

**Equilibrium:**

$$p_1^B = p_2^B = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.667$$
$$\pi_i^B = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.889$$

---

## MFN Adoption: Firm 1's Commitment

**Firm 1 commits to price:**

$$p_1^* = \frac{12}{7} \approx 1.714$$

**Firm 2's best response:**

$$p_2^* = BR_2(p_1^*) = \frac{47}{28} \approx 1.678$$

---

## MFN Outcome: Firm 1's Profit

**Outcomes:**

$$Q_1^* = \frac{5}{4}$$
$$\pi_1^* = \frac{25}{28} \approx 0.893 > 0.889$$

::: {.callout-note}
Firm 1's profits rise to $\approx 0.893$ from the Bertrand equilibrium level of $0.889$ by committing to a higher price via the MFN clause.
:::

---

## Deviation from MFN: Gross Profit

**Firm 1 considers deviating to:**

$$\tilde{p}_1 = BR_1(p_2^*) = \frac{187}{112} \approx 1.669$$

**Gross profit from deviation:**

$$\tilde{Q}_1 = \frac{75}{56}$$
$$\tilde{\pi}_1 = \frac{5625}{6272} \approx 0.897$$

---

## Deviation from MFN: Refund Obligation

**MFN requires refunds:**

$$\text{Refunds} = Q_1^* (p_1^* - \tilde{p}_1) = \frac{25}{448} \approx 0.056$$

**Net profit after refunds:**

$$\tilde{\pi}_1 - \text{Refunds} = \frac{5275}{6272} \approx 0.841$$

---

## MFN Self-Enforcement: Verification

::: {.callout-important}
## No Profitable Deviation
Net profit from deviation ($0.841$) is strictly less than profit under MFN commitment ($0.893$). 

The MFN clause is thus self-enforcing: no firm has incentive to deviate unilaterally.
:::

---

## Summary: Tacit Collusion

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Coordination problem:** Joint profit maximization yields higher payoffs than Nash equilibrium
2. **Single-period dilemma:** The Nash equilibrium is Pareto-inefficient
3. **Facilitating devices:** MFN clauses alter the payoff structure to align individual and collective incentives
4. **Self-enforcement:** Properly structured MFN clauses render deviation less profitable than compliance
