# Part I. Market Structures {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Industrial Organisation: Overview

Economic models rest on key assumptions about market structure and firm behaviour.

**Under perfect competition:**
- Markets are efficient
- Price equals marginal cost

**Under imperfect competition:**
- Markets generate welfare losses
- Strategic firm behaviour matters

## Beyond Static Models

In reality, many markets feature:

- **Dynamic entry/exit:** Number of firms changes over time
- **Product differentiation:** Firms compete on product variety
- **Technological change:** Innovation and R&D investment
- **Demand shifts:** Advertising and marketing effects

$\rightarrow$ Static models provide a foundation, but IO studies these dynamic elements.

## Review: Market Structures

Three key competitive regimes:

| Structure | # Firms | Price Setting | Output |
|-----------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Perfect Competition** | Many | Price-taker | Competitive |
| **Monopoly** | 1 | Monopolist | Restricted |
| **Cournot Oligopoly** | Few | Strategic | Intermediate |

## Pricing in Market Structures

**Perfect competition:**
- Price = MC (of most efficient firm)

**Monopoly:**
- Profit maximisation via price/quantity choice

**Cournot oligopoly:**
- Quantity competition with interdependence
- Strategic pricing via the Cournot formula

## Review: Market structures - pricing

Cournot maximisation:

$$
\max_{q_i} \left[q_i \left(P(q_i + q_{-i}) - c(q_i)\right)\right]
$$

Cournot Pricing Formula:

$$
\frac{P - c'(q_i)}{P}
= - \frac{q_i P' Q}{Q P}
= \frac{\alpha_i}{\eta}
$$

where  

$$
\alpha_i = \frac{q_i}{Q}
$$

is firm $i$’s market share  

$$
\eta = - \frac{dQ/Q}{dP/P}
$$

is the price elasticity of demand  

LHS is the mark-up rate (Lerner index)

- directly proportional to the firm’s market share  
- has inverse relationship with elasticity

## Review: Market structures - welfare analysis

Welfare analysis  

− consumer surplus (CS)  
− producer surplus/profit (PS)  
− welfare loss (WL)  

Equilibrium in  

- Perfect competition: max CS, no WL  
- Monopoly: max PS  
- Cournot oligopoly: inefficient from point of view of both sides  

$\rightarrow$ relationship between CS, PS, and WL is more complicated


## Example: Market structures - welfare analysis

Example exercise  

− Demand function: $P = 20 - Q$  

− Three firms with marginal costs:  
$c_1 = 0$, $c_2 = 5$, $c_3 = 7$  

Draw and compare CS, PS, and WL between the following market  
structures:

- “Perfect competition” (firm 1 charging $p = MC$)  
- “Monopoly” (firm 1)  
- Cournot triopoly

- “Perfect competition”: CS = 200, PS = 0, WL = 0  
- “Monopoly”: CS = 50, PS = 100, WL = 50  
- Cournot triopoly: ?

- Cournot triopoly: CS = 72, PS = ... < 96 , WL = ... > 32  


## Market structures - welfare analysis

Cournot oligopoly equilibrium maximises neither CS nor PS.

Consider the following maximisation problem:

$$
\max_Q
\left\{
(n - 1)\big[u(Q) - P(Q)Q\big]
+ n\left[P(Q)Q - n c\left(\frac{Q}{n}\right)\right]
\right\}
$$

− With $u'(Q) = P(Q)$, $n$ identical firms  

− FOC gives the same outcome as the Cournot equilibrium:

weight on PS (industry profits) is either  

- too much – compared to CS maximisation (social optimum)  
- too little – compared to joint profit maximisation

## Differentiated products: Cournot v Bertrand

Cournot duopoly  

− (Inverse) Demand functions:

$$
P_1 = a - b q_1 - d q_2
$$

$$
P_2 = a - d q_1 - b q_2
$$

− Assume $b > |d|$. $d \in (-b, b)$ is degree of product differentiation  

- $d < 0$: goods are complements  
- $d = 0$: goods are independent  
- $d > 0$: goods are substitutes  

For substitute goods,

$$
BR_i(q_j) = \frac{a - d q_j - c_i}{2b}
$$

is downward sloping  

- quantities are strategic substitutes  

---

## Differentiated products: Cournot v Bertrand

Bertrand duopoly  

− Demand functions:

$$
Q_1 = \tilde a - \tilde b p_1 + \tilde d p_2
$$

$$
Q_2 = \tilde a + \tilde d p_1 - \tilde b p_2
$$

- $\tilde a = \frac{a}{b+d}$  
- $\tilde b = \frac{b}{b^2 - d^2}$  
- $\tilde d = \frac{d}{b^2 - d^2}$  

For substitute goods,

$$
BR_i(p_j) = \frac{\tilde a + \tilde d p_j + \tilde b c_i}{2 \tilde b}
$$

is upward sloping  

- prices are strategic complements  

---

## Differentiated products: Cournot v Bertrand

Cournot equilibrium with $c_i = 0$

- $q_1 = q_2 = \frac{a}{2b + d}$  

- $p_i^C = \frac{ab}{2b + d}$  

Bertrand equilibrium with $c_i = 0$

- $p_i^B = \frac{a(b-d)}{2b - d}$  

We can show that

$$
p_i^C - p_i^B = \frac{a d^2}{4b^2 - d^2} > 0
$$

- price competition leads to lower prices, larger quantities  
than quantity competition  

- price as the strategic variable leads to a more competitive  
outcome than quantity as the strategic variable

## Oligopoly coordination: overview

- Tacit collusion: possible but difficult to achieve  

◦ interdependent outcomes but individual interests may not align  
◦ agreement and enforcement problems – incentives to deviate,  
credibility  

- ‘Facilitating devices’  

◦ ↑ incentives to cooperate, ↓ incentives to compete  
◦ formal contracts – focus of antitrust law  
◦ most-favoured-nation (MFN) or most-favoured-customer clause  

---

## Oligopoly coordination: Prisoner’s Dilemma

Payoff matrix of a game between firm A (row player) and firm B  
(column player), based on Table 9.1 in Salop (1985).

|      | pH | pL |
|------|----|----|
| pH   | 100 , 100 | -10 , 140 |
| pL   | 140 , -10 | 70 , 70 |

- Competitive point is $(p_L, p_L)$ – NE in single-period game  

- Cooperative point is $(p_H, p_H)$ – NE in a repeated game?  

- Transitional difficulties  

◦ issue of coordinating simultaneous move to cooperative point  
◦ leader (first mover) has reduced profits during transition  
◦ follower will have an incentive to delay price increase  
◦ leader will rethink move and might return back to $p_L$  

---

## Oligopoly coordination: Prisoner’s Dilemma (adjusted)

Adjusted payoff matrix, based on Table 9.2 in Salop (1985).

|      | pH | pL |
|------|----|----|
| pH   | 100 , 100 | -10 , 90 |
| pL   | 90 , -10 | 70 , 70 |

- Reduce follower firm’s transitional gain from 140 to 90  

- Now cooperative point $(p_H, p_H)$ is also a simple  
(single-period) NE  

- Start from competitive point $(p_L, p_L)$  

◦ If leader moves from $p_L$ to $p_H$, payoff changes from 70 to -10  
◦ BUT other firm is incentivised to follow suit immediately  
◦ Given that the leader firm has chosen $p_H$, moving from $p_L$ to  
$p_H$ increases payoff from 90 to 100  

---

## Oligopoly coordination: MFN clause

- A Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clause provides insurance to  
buyers against possibility of seller offering a lower price to  
other consumers  

◦ Seller commits to charging a specified (minimum) price  
◦ This price is slightly above the single-period NE price  
◦ If seller reduces price later, it needs to refund previous  
consumers by the price difference or pay penalty  
◦ Clause needs to be self-imposing: refunds/penalty required  
by the policy outweigh gains from price reduction  
◦ Clause reduces pricing flexibility of seller  

$\rightarrow$ unable to match any price discounts from other firms –  
competitive disadvantage  

---

## Oligopoly coordination: MFN clause

- Salop (1985): ‘free rider effect in reverse’  

◦ Consumers individually value MFN clause/contract  
◦ But there is an external cost to other consumers  

$\rightarrow$ prevents seller from offering discounts to future buyers  

◦ So collectively accepting the clause/contract eliminates  
the individual benefit  

---

## MFN clause: example

Bertrand duopoly with differentiated products  

− Demand functions:

$$
Q_1 = 3 - 2p_1 + p_2
$$

$$
Q_2 = 3 + p_1 - 2p_2
$$

− Assume $c_1 = c_2 = 1$  

Solve for equilibrium  

- $BR_i(p_j) = \frac{5 + p_j}{4}$  

- $p_1^B = p_2^B = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.667$  

- $\pi_i^B(p_1^B, p_2^B) = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.889$  

---

## MFN clause: example

Solving for Bertrand equilibrium  

◦ $BR_i(p_j) = \frac{5 + p_j}{4}$  

◦ $p_1^B = p_2^B = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.667$  

◦ $\pi_i^B(p_1^B, p_2^B) = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.889$  

Suppose firm 1 offers MFN clause with guaranteed price

$$
p_1^* = \frac{12}{7} \approx 1.714
$$

- Firm 2 will respond with  

$$
p_2^* = BR_2(p_1^*) = \frac{47}{28} \approx 1.678
$$

- $Q_1^* = \frac{5}{4}$  

- $\pi_1^* = \frac{25}{28} > \frac{8}{9} = \pi_1^B$  

---

## MFN clause: example

MFN clause with guaranteed price $p_1^* = \frac{12}{7} \approx 1.714$

◦ Firm 2 sets  

$$
p_2^* = BR_2(p_1^*) = \frac{47}{28} \approx 1.678
$$

◦ $Q_1^* = \frac{5}{4}$  

◦ $\pi_1^* = \frac{25}{28} \approx 0.893 > \pi_1^B$  

What happens if firm 1 deviates from MFN clause?

- Firm 1 will lower price to  

$$
\tilde p_1 = BR_1(p_2^*) = \frac{187}{112} \approx 1.669
$$

- $\tilde Q_1 = \frac{75}{56}$  

- Gross profit:  

$$
\tilde \pi_1 = \frac{5625}{6272} \approx 0.897 > \pi_1^* > \pi_1^B
$$

- Refunds:

$$
Q_1^*(p_1^* - \tilde p_1) = \frac{25}{448} \approx 0.056
$$

- Net profit:

$$
\tilde \pi_1 - \text{Refunds}
= \frac{5275}{6272}
\approx 0.841 < \pi_1^B < \pi_1^*
$$

---

## MFN clause: exercise

What if the MFN clause has a higher guaranteed price of  

$$
p_1^* = 2?
$$

- Firm 2 sets $p_2^* =$ ?  
- $Q_1^* =$ ?  
- $\pi_1^* =$ ?  

What happens and why?
