# Session Log: docs-release-review-dedupe
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Task:** docs: canonical lecture release review path + avoid duplicate review stacks

## Timeline
- **2026-02-11 17:47** Initialized plan and session log.
- **2026-02-11 17:47** User approved: implement canonical lecture release review path (/slide-excellence) + orchestrator-mode no-double-review rule, and align docs/skills accordingly.
- **2026-02-11 17:53** Implemented doc/skill changes to make /slide-excellence canonical release review and added orchestrator-mode no-double-stack hard rule. Discovered unexpected filesystem move: lecture figures now under lecture-slides/slides/figs/ with tracked lecture-slides/figs/* showing as deleted; awaiting user direction to restore or adopt new structure.
