# Session Log: create-lecture-lecture-4-patents
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Task:** create lecture: Lecture 4 patents (based on lecture-4-patents.qmd)

## Timeline
- **2026-02-11 16:26** Initialized plan and session log.
- **2026-02-11 16:31** Proceeding to finalize Lecture 4 patents deck from existing draft; adding objectives/roadmap + running application thread; fixing accidental slide breaks from headings inside callouts; resolving notation conflicts where needed.
- **2026-02-11 16:32** Outline set (Motivation+instruments; Ideas model length/screening; Breadth + endogenous R&D + patent races). Running application: pharmaceuticals. Notation decision: use lambda for DWL intensity to avoid conflict with ell from Hotelling.
- **2026-02-11 16:38** Implemented lecture scaffolding + fixes in lecture-4-patents.qmd: added learning objectives/roadmap and pharma running application; removed headings inside callouts (avoids accidental slide breaks); switched DWL parameter to lambda; added numeric example for duplication region; added refs block.

## Completion
- **2026-02-11 17:06** Updated lecture-4-patents.qmd with learning objectives/roadmap + pharma running application thread; fixed callout headings that created accidental slides; switched DWL parameter to lambda; added numerical duplication-region check; added refs block. Quarto render verified in a clean temp copy (OneDrive .quarto/site_libs reparse-point issues still block in-place render).
