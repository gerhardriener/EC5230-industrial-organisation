# Pedagogical Review: lecture-4-patents.qmd

**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Summary

- **Patterns followed:** 9/13
- **Patterns violated:** 2/13
- **Patterns partially applied:** 2/13

## High Severity

1. **Socratic embedding (Pattern 11)** — All Socratic questions are in speaker notes only; none appear on slides. Surface 2–3 questions onto slides: "Why can't we just rely on first-mover advantage?", "Would you prefer broad-short or narrow-long?", "What happens to the duplication region as $p$ increases?"

2. **Visual-first for complex concepts (Pattern 12)** — Zero diagrams across 22 content slides. Add at minimum: (a) monopoly diagram showing $\pi\nu$ and $\lambda\nu$ regions, (b) number-line diagram for duplication region $f_2^{publ} < f < f_2^{priv}$.

## Medium Severity

3. **Dense theorem split (Pattern 7)** — Patent race NE slide (line 495) combines callout, game structure, and equilibrium condition. Split into game structure + equilibrium condition slides.

4. **Pacing** — Shy model has 4 consecutive formal slides (lines 379–464) with no example or visual break. Insert a worked example or plot of $x^I(\tau)$.

## Low Severity

5. **Incremental notation** — Shy model setup introduces 5 symbols; a brief notation-recap callout would help.
6. **Semantic color** — No semantic color used for positive/negative effects. Could enhance key trade-off slides.
7. **Side-by-side comparisons** — Ideas A and B example could use two-column layout for sharper contrast.
8. **Student concerns** — Flag linearity assumption $\pi(x) = (a-c)x$ on-slide; flag sign change of $(1-2p)$ for $p > 0.5$ on-slide.

## Strengths

- Strong motivation-before-formalism arc (5 framing slides before any model).
- Progressive complexity: Scotchmer → Shy → patent races.
- Running pharmaceutical application provides excellent continuity.
- Consistent notation throughout.
- Good worked examples (Ideas A&B, numerical duplication check).
- Callout box usage follows hierarchy and fatigue rules.
