# Timing Analysis: live-exercise-1.qmd

**File:** `exercises/live/live-exercise-1.qmd`
**Exercise Type:** Live (group work)
**Target Time:** 15-20 minutes
**Review Date:** 2026-02-09

---

## Executive Summary

**Estimated Completion Time:** 25-33 minutes (including optional part d)
**Without Optional Parts:** 20-28 minutes (parts a,b,c,e,f)
**Deviation from Target:** +25% to +65% over 20-minute target

**Status:** ⚠️ **OVER TIME** (CRITICAL if including part d; MEDIUM without it)

**Recommendation:** Mark part (d) explicitly as "optional/challenge" OR remove parts (e) and (f) to fit 20-minute window.

## Time Breakdown by Part

### Part (a): Marginal consumer and demands

**Tasks:**
1. Write indifference condition
2. Solve for x* (quadratic algebra)
3. Derive q1(p1,p2) and q2(p1,p2)

**Estimated Time:**
- Write indifference: 1-2 min (straightforward utility comparison)
- Solve for x*: 2-3 min (expanding (x-a)² - (1-a-x)², factoring, isolating x)
- Write demands: 1 min (x* = q1 by definition)

**Subtotal:** 4-6 minutes

**Complexity:** STANDARD (requires careful algebra with squared terms)

---

### Part (b): Best responses in prices

**Tasks:**
1. FOC for Firm 1
2. Simplify to BR₁(p₂)
3. FOC for Firm 2
4. Simplify to BR₂(p₁)

**Estimated Time:**
- FOC for Firm 1: 2-3 min (differentiation of π₁ = (p₁ - c₁)q₁, substitute ∂q₁/∂p₁ = -1/(2td), solve)
- FOC for Firm 2: 2-3 min (symmetric)

**Subtotal:** 4-6 minutes

**Complexity:** STANDARD (routine FOC derivation, algebra similar to linear Hotelling but with td term)

---

### Part (c): Price equilibrium

**Tasks:**
1. Solve 2×2 system of BR functions
2. Compute equilibrium market shares
3. Show price gap p₂* - p₁* = (c₂-c₁)/3
4. Explain how distance d affects average markup

**Estimated Time:**
- Solve system: 3-4 min (substitute BR₁ into BR₂, back-substitute)
- Compute shares: 2 min (substitute prices into demand)
- Show price gap: 1 min (subtract equilibrium prices)
- Discuss distance effect: 2 min (identify td term, explain economic mechanism)

**Subtotal:** 8-9 minutes

**Complexity:** STANDARD to CHALLENGING (system solving is routine, interpretation requires understanding differentiation)

---

### Part (d): Interior condition (OPTIONAL CHALLENGE)

**Tasks:**
1. Derive condition |c₂-c₁| < 3td from q₁*, q₂* ∈ (0,1)
2. Economic interpretation

**Estimated Time:**
- Derive condition: 3-4 min (set q₁* < 1 and q₂* > 0, manipulate inequality)
- Economic interpretation: 2 min (explain "cost difference too large")

**Subtotal:** 5-6 minutes

**Complexity:** CHALLENGE (requires recognizing equilibrium validity conditions)

**Note:** Currently labeled "optional challenge" in line 78, which is good. However, many students may attempt it anyway if time permits.

---

### Part (e): Numerical check

**Tasks:**
Compute (p₁*, p₂*, q₁*, q₂*) with a=1/4, t=2, c₁=0, c₂=1

**Estimated Time:**
- Calculate d = 1/2: 30 sec
- Calculate td = 1: 30 sec
- Compute p₁* = 4/3: 1 min
- Compute p₂* = 5/3, q₁* = 2/3, q₂* = 1/3: 1-2 min

**Subtotal:** 2-3 minutes

**Complexity:** ROUTINE (substitution and arithmetic)

---

### Part (f): Discussion question

**Tasks:**
Explain why quadratic costs make competition depend on distance, unlike linear costs

**Estimated Time:**
- Read and understand question: 1 min
- Formulate answer using expressions from (c): 2-3 min

**Subtotal:** 2-3 minutes

**Complexity:** STANDARD (conceptual, requires understanding demand elasticity ∂q₁/∂p₁ = 1/(2td))

---

## Total Time Estimates

### Scenario 1: All parts including (d)
**Sum:** 4-6 + 4-6 + 8-9 + 5-6 + 2-3 + 2-3 = 25-33 minutes
**+10% reading buffer:** 28-36 minutes
**Status:** **CRITICAL** (40-80% over 20-minute target)

### Scenario 2: Skip part (d) [recommended]
**Sum:** 4-6 + 4-6 + 8-9 + 2-3 + 2-3 = 20-27 minutes
**+10% buffer:** 22-30 minutes
**Status:** **MEDIUM** (10-50% over target)

### Scenario 3: Only (a)-(c) [tightest time]
**Sum:** 4-6 + 4-6 + 8-9 = 16-21 minutes
**+10% buffer:** 18-23 minutes
**Status:** **GOOD** (0-15% over target, within acceptable range)

## Comparison to Target

| Scenario | Min (min) | Max (min) | % of 20-min target | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| All parts (a-f) | 28 | 36 | 140-180% | CRITICAL: TOO LONG |
| Skip (d) — (a,b,c,e,f) | 22 | 30 | 110-150% | MEDIUM: Slightly over |
| Core only — (a,b,c) | 18 | 23 | 90-115% | GOOD: Near target |

**Target benchmark:** 15-22 minutes (75-110% of 20-minute target) is EXCELLENT

---

## Timing Issues

### Issue 1: Too many sub-questions (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** 6 sub-questions (a-f) is excessive for a 20-minute exercise.

**Evidence:**
- Even skipping optional (d), estimated time is 22-30 min
- With (d), exercise takes 28-36 min (up to 80% over target)

**Impact:** Students will rush final parts or not finish, reducing learning value

**Recommended Fix (choose one):**

**Option A (Remove numerical/discussion):**
- Keep (a), (b), (c), (d-optional)
- Remove (e) and (f)
- New total: 18-23 min ✓ GOOD

**Option B (Make more optional):**
- Required: (a), (b), (c) only
- Optional: (d), (e), (f) labeled "if time permits"
- Core total: 18-23 min ✓ GOOD

**Option C (Simplify part c):**
- Combine "show price gap" and "discuss distance" into one question
- Keep (a), (b), (c-simplified), (e)
- Remove (d) and (f)
- New total: ~18-22 min ✓ GOOD

---

### Issue 2: Part (c) is dense (MEDIUM)

**Problem:** Part (c) has 4 distinct tasks:
1. Solve equilibrium
2. Compute shares
3. Show price gap formula
4. Discuss distance effect

**Evidence:** Estimated 8-9 minutes for one "part" is high

**Impact:** May feel overwhelming; students might not finish all tasks

**Recommended Fix:**
Split into (c) and (c') or simplify:
- **(c)** Solve for (p₁*, p₂*) and (q₁*, q₂*)
- **(c')** Show that p₂* - p₁* = (c₂-c₁)/3 and explain how distance affects markups

This makes progression clearer and allows partial credit.

---

### Issue 3: No warm-up (LOW)

**Problem:** Part (a) immediately requires nontrivial algebra (expanding quadratics, factoring)

**Evidence:** Part (a) is 4-6 minutes, which is appropriate for a main derivation but quick for a warm-up

**Impact:** Groups may struggle to get started, eating into time for later parts

**Recommended Fix (optional):**
Add a sub-part (a.0) before current (a):
- **(a.0)** "Write down the utility functions for a consumer at location x buying from Firm 1 and Firm 2." [1 min]
- Then proceed to current (a)

This gives students a moment to orient before tackling the algebra.

## Pedagogical Timing Notes

### Strengths

1. **Logical progression:** (a) → (b) → (c) is classic IO textbook sequence (demands → FOCs → equilibrium)
2. **Scaffolding:** Earlier parts set up later parts (demands from (a) are used in (b), BRs from (b) used in (c))
3. **Validation:** Part (e) numerical check helps students verify algebraic work

### Weaknesses

1. **No breathing room:** 25-33 min for a "15-minute" exercise (line 21) leaves no buffer for group discussion or questions
2. **Back-loaded complexity:** Parts (d), (e), (f) come after the hardest work, when students are mentally fatigued
3. **Optional not clearly scoped:** Part (d) says "optional challenge" but (e) and (f) are not marked optional, even though time will be tight

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (CRITICAL): Reduce scope

**Choose one:**

1. **Remove (e) and (f)** → Total: 18-23 min ✓
2. **Make (d), (e), (f) all optional** → Core: 18-23 min ✓
3. **Keep only (a), (b), (c), (e)** → Total: ~20-25 min (closer to target)

### Priority 2 (MEDIUM): Clarify instructions

1. **Update line 21** from "≈15 minutes" to "≈20 minutes" to match actual scope
2. **Label optional parts explicitly:**
   - "### (d) [OPTIONAL] When does one firm..."
   - "### (e) [OPTIONAL] Quick numerical check"
   - "### (f) [OPTIONAL] Discussion"

### Priority 3 (LOW): Split part (c)

Make it two sub-parts (c) and (c') for clarity and pacing.

## Comparison to Timing Heuristics

| Task Type | Heuristic | Actual in Exercise | Match? |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Indifference condition derivation | 3-4 min | 2-3 min (part a, step 2) | ✓ Faster (simpler algebra) |
| Demand functions | 1-2 min | 1 min (part a, step 3) | ✓ Match |
| FOC derivation | 3-4 min per firm | 2-3 min per firm (part b) | ✓ Slightly faster (standard) |
| Solve 2×2 system | 3-4 min | 3-4 min (part c) | ✓ Match |
| Numerical computation | 2-3 min | 2-3 min (part e) | ✓ Match |
| Conceptual discussion | 2-3 min | 2-3 min (part f) | ✓ Match |

**Conclusion:** Individual task estimates align well with heuristics. The TOTAL time issue arises from having TOO MANY tasks, not from misestimating individual tasks.

## Final Verdict

**Estimated Time:** 25-33 minutes (all parts) or 20-28 minutes (skip d)
**Target:** 20 minutes
**Deviation:** +25% to +65%

**Quality Gate:** ❌ FAILS (exceeds 20% deviation threshold)

**Status:** NEEDS REVISION to reduce scope

**After fixes:** If parts (e) and (f) removed → 18-23 min → ✓ GOOD (within 15% of target)
