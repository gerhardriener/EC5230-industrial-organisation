### Critical Issues
- None identified.

### Medium Issues
1. Potential overflow risk from a long callout sentence.
   - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:277`
2. Dense piecewise-profit slide may overload pacing.
   - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:143`
3. Clustering-motives slide needs a clearer bridge into the formal location game.
   - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:118`
4. Consecutive Salop slides reuse the same figure without enough added analytical content.
   - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:175`
5. Citation formatting issue in one line (`(@key line)` style).
   - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:36`
6. Missing punctuation in an explanatory sentence ("centre firms will...").
   - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:116`
7. One bullet is split awkwardly across lines.
   - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:124`

### Citation Key Findings
- Citation keys detected in the deck:
  - `@hotellingStabilityCompetition1929`
  - `@daspremontHotellingsStabilityCompetition1979`
  - `@salopMonopolisticCompetitionOutside1979`
- All keys resolve in `references.bib`.
- No hardcoded author-year citations without `@key` were detected.
- One citation syntax/style issue remains at `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:36`.

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Apply the three medium proofreading fixes first (lines 36, 116, 124).
2. Split the long callout sentence at line 277 into shorter chunks.
3. Add a one-sentence narrative bridge on the clustering-motives slide.
4. Replace one duplicated Salop-cycle figure instance with a worked boundary example.
