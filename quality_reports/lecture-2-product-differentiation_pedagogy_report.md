# Pedagogy Report: lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd

## Overall Pedagogical Read
- Narrative arc is strong: Hotelling fixed-location pricing -> location incentives -> Salop free entry and welfare.
- Mathematical progression is coherent and notation mostly consistent.
- Slide segmentation is granular enough for board discussion and pauses.

## Findings

### Medium
1. The clustering-motives slide is under-scaffolded relative to what follows.
   - Location: `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:118`
   - Issue: rhetorical bullets do not explicitly bridge to the d'Aspremont et al. formal result slide.
   - Recommendation: add one bridge line ("Next: formal location game shows when clustering fails under linear transport costs.").

2. The Salop cycle figure is repeated on consecutive conceptual slides with little added explanatory content.
   - Locations:
     - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:175`
     - `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:192`
   - Recommendation: keep figure once and use the second slide for a worked boundary example.

### Low
1. The planner-vs-entry welfare conclusion is correct but could use one explicit intuition sentence before the final summary.
   - Location: `lecture-slides/slides/lecture-2-product-differentiation.qmd:314`
   - Recommendation: add a one-line intuition for business-stealing externality magnitude.

## Strengths
- Clear separation between monopoly-region and competitive-region demand logic.
- Good use of callouts to highlight economically meaningful comparisons (slope comparison, convexity intuition).
- Ends with useful forward link to next lecture topic.
