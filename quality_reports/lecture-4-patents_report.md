## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| High     | 1     |
| Medium   | 3     |
| Low      | 6     |

## High Severity

1. **Truncated speaker notes (line 90)** — Notes end with `"copyright is life + 70 y[No endpoint found]"`. Complete the sentence.

## Medium Severity

2. **Missing $F$ in planner formula (lines 240–242)** — Displayed formula shows $\nu/r - \lambda\nu T$ but notes and numerical example include $-F$. Add $-F$ or relabel as "gross social value net of DWL."

3. **Inconsistent R&D escaping** — Mix of `R\&D` (lines 48, 68, 98, 99, 383) and `R&D` elsewhere. Standardise to plain `R&D` throughout.

4. **"Next week" preview mismatch (line 590)** — Preview says "multi-stage games" (Stackelberg, delegation) but Lecture 5 file is titled "Repeated Games." Reconcile label with actual content.

## Low Severity

5. Overflow risk on "Example: ideas A and B" slide (borderline).
6. Silent switch from continuous to discrete time between Scotchmer and Shy sections.
7. Citation keys in section headers — verify Pandoc renders `@citekey` correctly in RevealJS titles.
8. Double space before "model" in Shy section header (line 379).
9. Italic word-like superscripts: `$f^{priv}_2$` should be `$f_2^{\text{priv}}$`.
10. Linear profit assumption — already caveated in speaker notes; no action required.
