It is of vital importance that we understand the economic principles governing how these platforms operate. This book explains the driving forces behind any platform business with a focus on network effects. The authors use short case studies and real-world applications to explain key concepts such as how platforms manage network effects and which price and non-price strategies they choose. This self-contained text is the first to offer a systematic and formalized account of what platforms are and how they operate, concisely incorporating path-breaking insights in economics over the last twenty years.},

This comprehensive textbook acquaints readers with the most important models for understanding strategies chosen by firms with market power and shows how such firms adapt to different market environments. The second edition includes new and revised formal models and case studies. Formal models are presented in detail, and analyses are summarized in 'lessons' which highlight the main insights. Theories are complemented by numerous real-world cases that engage students and lead them to connect theories to real situations. Chapters include review questions, exercises, and suggestions for further reading to enhance the learning experience, and an accompanying website offers additional student exercises, as well as teaching slides.},

  abstract = {It is not self-evident that economists ought to engage in the task of explaining the characteristics of technological innovations. It is even less evident that development and inventive activities are related to the structure of economic organisations. Or so it would seem from the near-complete absence of a discussion of such issues in resource- allocation theory.2 So would it seem, as well, from the sheer volume of effort that has been spent over the past quarter of a century in trying to demonstrate that economic forces are a prime architect of technological change.3 If there is a single driving force behind these empirical investigations, it is the writings of Joseph Schumpeter (most especially perhaps his Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, Schumpeter, 1976). Since recent developments in the theory of technological competition have addressed a few of the empirical findings, they reflect this heritage as well.},

  publisher = {MIT Press},
  address = {Cambridge, Mass},
  abstract = {This upper-level undergraduate text provides an introduction to industrial organization theory along with applications and nontechnical analyses of the legal system and antitrust laws. Using the modern approach but without emphasizing the mathematical generality inherent in many of the arguments, it bridges the gap between existing nontheoretical texts written for undergraduates and highly technical texts written for graduate students. The book can also be used in masters' programs, and advanced graduate students will find it a convenient guide to modern industrial organization.The treatment is rigorous and comprehensive. A wide range of models of all widely used market structures, strategic marketing devices, compatibility and standards, advertising, R\&D, as well as more traditional topics are considered in versions much simplified from the originals but that retain the basic intuition.Shy first defines the issues that industrial organization addresses and then develops the tools needed to attack the basic questions. He begins with perfect competition and then considers imperfectly competitive market structures including a wide variety of monopolies, and all forms of quantity and price competitions. The last chapter provides a helpful feature for students by showing how various theories may be related to particular industries but not to others.Topics include: the basics needed to understand modern industrial organization; market structure (monopoly, homogenous products, differentiated products); mergers and entry; research and development; economics of compatibility and standards; advertising; quality and durability; pricing tactics; marketing tactics; management, compensation, and information; price dispersion and search theory; and special industries.},
