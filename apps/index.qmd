## Interactive Visualisations

Explore key industrial organisation models with these interactive Shiny applications. Each app allows you to adjust parameters and observe how equilibrium outcomes change.

::: {.callout-note}
## Running the Apps
These apps require R and Shiny. You can run them locally by opening the `.R` file in RStudio or Positron and clicking "Run App".

### Cournot Duopoly Best Responses

**File:** `cournot-duopoly/cournot-duopoly-app.R`

Visualise the **best response functions** (reaction curves) in a Cournot duopoly with homogeneous goods.

**Key concepts:**

- Best response functions: $R_i(q_j)$ and $R_j(q_i)$
- Cournot-Nash equilibrium as the intersection of reaction curves
- Effect of cost asymmetries on equilibrium quantities
- Iso-profit contours

**Parameters you can adjust:**

- Demand intercept ($a$) and slope ($b$)
- Marginal costs for each firm ($c_i$, $c_j$)
- Iso-profit curve levels

### Residual Monopolist's Best Response

**File:** `monopolist-profits/monopolist-best-response-app.R`

Explore the **residual demand** problem facing a Cournot firm, showing how a firm's optimal output depends on rival production.

**Key concepts:**

- Residual demand function
- Profit maximisation given rival output
- Derivation of the best response function
- Shift in profit curves as rival output changes

**Parameters you can adjust:**

- Demand intercept ($a$) and slope ($b$)
- Marginal cost ($c$)
- Rival output level ($q_j$)

### Profit Possibility Frontier

**File:** `profit-possibility-cournot/profit-possibility-frontier-app.R`

Visualise the **profit possibility frontier** showing all Pareto-efficient profit combinations for two Cournot firms.

**Key concepts:**

- Cournot equilibrium profits ($\pi_i^C$, $\pi_j^C$)
- Monopoly profits ($\pi_i^M$, $\pi_j^M$)
- Collusion profits and the contract curve
- Stackelberg leader/follower profits
- Inefficiency of non-cooperative equilibrium

**Parameters you can adjust:**

- Demand intercept ($a$) and slope ($b$)
- Marginal costs for each firm ($c_i$, $c_j$)
- Minimum profit constraints

### Salop Circular City Model

**File:** `salop-circle/salop-circular-city-app.R`

Visualise the **Salop circular city model** of spatial/horizontal product differentiation with 3 firms.

**Key concepts:**

- Spatial competition on a circular market
- Transportation costs and consumer choice
- Market boundaries between firms
- Effect of pricing on market shares
- Horizontal product differentiation

**Parameters you can adjust:**

- Consumer location on the circle
- Each firm's price towards neighbouring firms
- Market boundary positions

## Getting Started

To run any app:

1. Ensure you have R installed with the `shiny` and `ggplot2` packages
2. Open the `.R` file in RStudio or Positron
3. Click the "Run App" button or run `shiny::runApp("path/to/app.R")`

```r
# Install required packages if needed
install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2"))
```
