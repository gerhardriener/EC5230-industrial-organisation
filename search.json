Key module information SCOTCAT credits\n15 The Scottish Credit Accumulation and Transfer (SCOTCAT) system allows credits gained in Scotland to be transferred between institutions. The number of credits associated with a module gives an indication of the amount of learning effort required by the learner. European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits are half the value of SCOTCAT credits. SCQF level\nSCQF level 11 The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) provides an indication of the complexity of award qualifications and associated learning and operates on an ascending numeric scale from Levels 1-12 with SCQF Level 10 equating to a Scottish undergraduate Honours degree. Availability restrictions\nAvailable to MSc students only Planned timetable\nTo be arranged This information is given as indicative. Timetable may change at short notice depending on room availability. Module Staff\nTo be arranged This information is given as indicative. Staff involved in a module may change at short notice depending on availability and circumstances. Module description\nThis module will provide a thorough advanced treatment of the core models and concepts used in modern analysis of industrial organisation. It is a specialised branch of microeconomics, which focuses on the structure and mechanisms governing markets and on the way firms compete against each other in the pursuit of profit maximisation. It will examine questions such as: what determines a market’s structure? How does market organisation influence firms’ behaviour and market performance? How can a firm’s strategy affect a market’s structure (e.g. by deterring other firms to enter)? Topics to be covered include perfect competition, monopoly, pricing strategies, static oligopoly models, collusion, product differentiation, innovation, advertising, and networks. Assessment pattern\n25% Coursework, 75% exam Re-assessment\nExam 100% Learning and teaching methods and delivery Weekly contact\n16 hours of lectures over 10 weeks, 1-hour tutorial (x 5 weeks)\nScheduled learning hours: 21\nGuided independent study hours: 129 The number of hours that students are expected to invest in independent study over the period of the module.\nIntended learning outcomes\n- Understand how IO can deepen the understanding of behaviour of firms/agent especially in imperfectly competitive market.\n- Developing the skill of selecting the right model(s) to analyse various issues in industrial economics\n- Develop the skill of analysing economic behaviour through game theory\n- Develop curiosity leading to identifying interesting and relevant papers/examples to extend knowledge of the subject."

Emphasise that the replacement effect, the appropriability gap, and the private-vs-social wedge all point in the same direction: without intervention, private R&D incentives are too weak.\nPose the question on the slide as a genuine open problem: IPRs are one response, but they come with their own costs. This sets up the central trade-off that runs through the entire lecture."

(Florio 2022)\nThis creates at wedge:\n\nex ante: strong incentives to race\nex post: fragmented rights → bargaining, “hold-up” risk, and politically salient access constraints\n\nProposed “third way”: patent pooling to expand access while preserving incentives (Billette de Villemeur et al., SSRN 2023)\n\npool aggregates relevant rights and offers standardized licences (reducing transaction costs)\ngoal: maximize access subject to participation/incentive constraints\npositioned as an alternative to: (i) full waiver, (ii) fully fragmented bilateral licensing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign margin\n\n\nPooling is a market design response: reduce IP fragmentation/frictions without eliminating IP rents entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Florio (2022) to motivate why purely “private property” framing is politically unstable when taxpayers funded upstream knowledge. Then introduce pooling (Billette de Villemeur et al.) as an IO mechanism: coordination device that can mitigate anticommons/hold-up and accelerate diffusion. Tie back to your lecture: this is breadth/transferability in practice (licensing rules + governance)."
