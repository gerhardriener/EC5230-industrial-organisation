    "text": "Date: 2026-02-08 Task: Complete slide-excellence review and apply all critical/major fixes Status: COMPLETED Quality Score: GOOD → EXCELLENT\n\n\n\nUser requested /slide-excellence review of lecture-3-innovation.qmd after fixing a TikZ compilation error. The review identified 4 critical, 13 major, and 15 minor issues across QMD content, TikZ diagrams, and pedagogical structure.\nUser then requested three specific pedagogical improvements: 1. Early Socratic question connecting innovation to economic growth (Industrial Revolution) 2. Full α definition in notation table (not just description) 3. De-densify theory stretch and clarify assumptions (Cournot, timing, α usage)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles Reviewed: - lecture-3-innovation.qmd (558 lines, 35 content slides) - fig-innovation-drastic-threshold.tex - fig-innovation-replacement-effect.tex - fig-innovation-inverted-u.tex\nIssues Identified: - 4 Critical (blocking compilation or creating visual ambiguity) - 13 Major (pedagogical gaps, TikZ visual issues) - 15 Minor (polish and consistency)\nKey Strengths: - Excellent narrative arc (monopoly → competition → strategic → general framework) - Strong empirical grounding (4 well-placed examples) - Consistent notation within lecture - Good use of fragment reveals\nKey Weaknesses: - D-S derivation compressed into one dense slide (5 algebraic steps) - TikZ visual clarity issues (overlapping fills, missing labels, disconnected annotations) - Passive first half (no Socratic engagement until slide 19) - α notation used before formal definition - Implicit assumptions (Cournot, timing not stated)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: Missing conjunction in list Fix: “Take \\(A=20\\), \\(c_0=10\\), \\(c_1=6\\)” → “Take \\(A=20\\), \\(c_0=10\\), and \\(c_1=6\\)” Rationale: Standard English grammar for serial lists\n\n\n\nProblem: Node with line break \\\\ missing align parameter → “Not allowed in LR mode” LaTeX error Fix: Added align=center to node definition Rationale: LaTeX requires explicit alignment for multi-line nodes\n\n\n\nProblem: Learning objectives used (Arrow) and (Dasgupta–Stiglitz) instead of proper @citationKey Fix: - Line 34: (Arrow) → [@arrowEconomicWelfareAllocation1972] - Lines 36, 42: (Dasgupta–Stiglitz) → [@dasguptaIndustrialStructureNature1980] Rationale: Consistent citation format, proper hyperlinks, bibliography integration\n\n\n\nProblem: Blue monopoly profit rectangle filled with opacity, overlapping green non-drastic profit rectangle → visual ambiguity Fix: Changed blue from fill=blue!12, draw=none to fill=none, draw=blue!70!black, thick Rationale: Outline-only avoids overlap confusion, maintains visual distinction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: 5 algebraic steps compressed into one slide: 1. State two conditions 2. Equate them 3. Introduce α 4. Divide by P 5. Substitute c/P and solve\nFix: Split into two slides: - Slide I “Setup”: State and equate the two conditions, forward pointer - Slide II “Solution”: Introduce α formally, substitute with labeled terms using \\underbrace{}, complete derivation\nRationale: Pattern 7 (two-slide strategy for dense theorems). Students need time to process each step. The α symbol was being used before formal definition.\n\n\n\nProblem: Panel A has vertical dashed lines at Q^m(c₀) and Q^m(c₁) with no x-axis labels Fix: Added labels $Q^m_0$ and $Q^m_1$ below vertical lines Rationale: Panel B has “\\(A-c_0\\)” label; Panel A needs symmetry. Students can’t read monopoly quantities from figure without labels.\n\n\n\nProblem: Generic single-word label “gain” provides no quantification Fix: Removed (already have quantified “\\(\\Delta\\pi^m = 24\\)” label at line 70) Rationale: Redundant and ambiguous. Quantified label is sufficient.\n\n\n\nProblem: “\\(\\Delta\\pi^m = 24\\)” label floats at (7.5, 3) with no visual connection to blue gain regions Fix: Added arrow: \\draw[-&gt;, blue!70!black, thick] (axis cs:7,3.5) -- (axis cs:6,7); Rationale: Pattern from visual quality rules: annotations connect to features they describe\n\n\n\nProblem: “Pre-innovation: π=0” at (12, 11) is above demand curve at that x-coordinate (demand at x=12 is P=8, label at y=11) Fix: Repositioned to (10.5, 10.5) with anchor=west and added arrow to equilibrium point (10, 10) Rationale: Equilibrium occurs at (A-c₀, c₀) = (10, 10). Label should point to that location.\n\n\n\nProblem: Blue shaded area totals 34 (bottom: 7×4=28, right: 2×3=6), but Δπ^m = 24. The “lost strip” from price drop (P^m(c₀)=15 to P^m(c₁)=13) was implicit, not visually distinguished. Fix: Added explicit darker red shading for lost profit strip (0,13)-(5,13)-(5,15)-(0,15) with label “lost: 10” Rationale: Visual arithmetic must be transparent: gain = +34 (blue) - 10 (dark red lost strip) = 24. Students were seeing visual discrepancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: First Socratic moment appeared on slide 19/35 (54% into lecture) → passive first half Fix: Added new discussion slide after monopoly WTP:\n## Discussion: Why does innovation matter for growth?\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution (~1760–1840), global GDP per capita was\nroughly flat for centuries. Since then, it has grown exponentially.\n\n**Question for you:**\n- What role did innovation (new production methods, machinery, transport)\n  play in this transformation?\n- Why might market structure affect the *rate* of innovation — and therefore\n  long-run growth?\n- Should we expect monopolies or competitive markets to innovate more?\n  (We'll answer this formally in a moment.)\nRationale: - Connects abstract theory to big-picture economic question - Motivates replacement effect analysis that follows - First Socratic moment now at slide 12/37 (32%) instead of slide 19/35 (54%) - Sets up monopoly vs competition comparison\n\n\n\nProblem: Notation table said “Innovative potential (R&D cost elasticity)” but didn’t show formula. α appears in derivation (line 455) before formal definition (line 470) → student confusion. Fix: Updated notation table:\n| $\\alpha$ | Parameter | Innovative potential: $\\alpha = -\\frac{dc(x)}{dx}\\frac{x}{c}$ (R&D cost elasticity) |\nRationale: Students see the full mathematical definition when α is first introduced. Eliminates “where did \\(x/(cq) = \\alpha\\) come from?” confusion in derivation.\n\n\n\nProblem: D-S model implicitly uses Cournot (the \\(1/(N\\varepsilon)\\) term is Cournot markup) but never states this explicitly Fix: Added before firm’s problem:\n**Assumptions:** Firms engage in **Cournot (quantity) competition** with\nsymmetric costs. Each firm chooses R&D expenditure $x_i$ and output $q_i$\nsimultaneously.\nRationale: Prerequisite assumption should be stated before optimization problem. Students familiar with game theory need to know the game structure.\n\n\n\nProblem: Setup described payoffs but not game structure (simultaneous? sequential? auction? race?) Fix: Added after setup:\n**Timing/game structure:** We compare the **willingness to pay** for innovation\n(e.g., in a patent auction or R&D race). The innovation is awarded to whichever\nfirm values it more highly. Entry happens *after* the innovation is allocated.\nRationale: Students need to understand this is a valuation comparison (like auction or race), not a Nash equilibrium in R&D spending. Clarifies that entry is post-allocation.\n\n\n\nProblem: 7-slide unbroken theory stretch: firm problem → pricing FOC → free entry → derivation → concentration → illustration → comparative statics. Dense algebra without conceptual roadmap. Fix: Added new slide “Intuition check: What determines N*?” before pricing FOC:\n## Intuition check: What determines $N^*$?\n\nBefore we dive into first-order conditions, think about the forces at work:\n\n- **Entry incentive:** If industry profits are positive, more firms want to enter\n- **R&D cost:** Each firm must spend $x^*$ to achieve low cost $c(x^*)$\n- **Market power:** More firms → lower mark-ups → lower operating profits\n- **Zero-profit equilibrium:** Entry stops when operating profits just cover R&D outlays\n\n**Key insight:** Equilibrium concentration ($N^*$) balances these forces.\nWe'll derive the precise formula by combining the pricing and free-entry conditions.\nRationale: - Breaks dense theory stretch into digestible chunks - Provides conceptual roadmap before technical derivation - Students understand why we’re doing the algebra, not just how\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction: Ran python scripts/tikz2pdf.py to regenerate all 11 SVG diagrams after TikZ source fixes Result: All diagrams compiled successfully Note: Fixed Windows encoding issue in tikz2pdf.py (Unicode checkmarks → ASCII-safe [OK] and [SKIP])\n\n\n\nCommand: quarto render lecture-3-innovation.qmd --to pdf Result: SUCCESS - 2 LuaLaTeX passes, no errors Output: _site/lecture-slides/slides/lecture-3-innovation.pdf\n\n\n\nCommand: quarto render lecture-3-innovation.qmd --to html Result: SUCCESS - all SVG figures display correctly Output: _site/lecture-slides/slides/lecture-3-innovation.html Note: Quarto 1.9.19 “Program Files” path bug remains (SASS compiler issue), but doesn’t block HTML output in this case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlecture-slides/slides/lecture-3-innovation.qmd\n\nLines 154, 261: Grammar fix (added conjunction)\nLines 34, 36, 42: Hardcoded citations → @citationKey\nAfter line 108: Added “Discussion: Why does innovation matter for growth?” slide\nLine 382: Updated α definition in notation table\nLine 314: Added timing/game structure clarification (entry threat)\nLine 419: Added Cournot competition assumption\nAfter line 431: Added “Intuition check: What determines N*?” slide\nLines 448-479: Split D-S derivation into two slides (Setup + Solution)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlecture-slides/figs/source/fig-innovation-inverted-u.tex\n\nLine 44: Added align=center to “Perfect competition” node\n\nlecture-slides/figs/source/fig-innovation-drastic-threshold.tex\n\nLine 54: Changed blue monopoly profit from filled to outline only\n\nlecture-slides/figs/source/fig-innovation-replacement-effect.tex\n\nLines 73, 76: Added x-axis quantity labels \\(Q^m_0\\) and \\(Q^m_1\\) to Panel A\nLine 67: Removed vague “gain” label\nLine 69: Added arrow connecting \\(\\Delta\\pi^m\\) label to blue gain regions\nLines 115-117: Repositioned “Pre-innovation: π=0” label with arrow to equilibrium\nLines 48-50: Added darker red shading for “lost profit strip” with “lost: 10” label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscripts/tikz2pdf.py\n\nLines 123, 125, 127: Replaced Unicode symbols with ASCII-safe [OK] and [SKIP] for Windows compatibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore: GOOD Issues: 4 critical, 13 major, 15 minor Blockers: - TikZ compilation error preventing PDF render - Dense derivation slide (cognitive overload) - Visual ambiguity in diagrams - Passive first half (no engagement)\n\n\n\nScore: EXCELLENT Issues: 0 critical, 3 minor (polish/preference) Remaining Minor Issues: - Box fatigue (19 callouts - could reduce to ~12 by demoting “Interpretation” notes) - Visual-first principle (could move drastic/replacement diagrams before algebra) - No D-S comparative statics figure (could add plot of 1/N* vs α)\nStatus: Ready for teaching\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious: 35 content slides Current: 37 content slides (added 2 pedagogical slides)\nPacing improvements: - First Socratic moment: slide 19 → slide 12 (54% → 32% into lecture) - D-S theory section: 7 consecutive dense slides → broken into 2 setup + 1 intuition + 5 derivation - Assumptions clarified before use (Cournot, timing, α)\nSection breakdown: 1. Introduction & motivation (7 slides) 2. Benchmarks (16 slides) - now includes early Socratic question 3. Strategic innovation (7 slides) 4. Dasgupta-Stiglitz (15 slides) - now includes intuition break\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision: Two-slide split (Setup + Solution) Rationale: 5 algebraic steps on one slide violates Pattern 7 (two-slide strategy for dense theorems). Students need time to process α introduction, substitution logic, and final formula. Splitting allows forward pointer, labeled intermediate steps with \\underbrace{}, and clearer pedagogical progression.\n\n\n\nDecision: New discussion slide after monopoly benchmark Rationale: Connects abstract IO theory to “why it matters” big picture (economic growth). Motivates the monopoly vs competition comparison that follows. Breaks passive first half - students engage with ideas before seeing formal proofs. Aligns with pedagogy-reviewer recommendation for early Socratic embedding.\n\n\n\nDecision: Show \\(\\alpha = -\\frac{dc(x)}{dx}\\frac{x}{c}\\) in table, not just description Rationale: α appears in derivation (line 467: “\\(\\frac{x}{cq} = \\alpha\\)”) before formal definition (line 470). Students were confused about where this relationship came from. Including formula in notation table (line 382) establishes it upfront.\n\n\n\nDecision: Vague label removed, quantified label connected Rationale: “gain” provides no information (what gain? how much?). The quantified “\\(\\Delta\\pi^m = 24\\)” label was already present but floating disconnected. Following visual quality rules, annotations should connect to the elements they describe. Arrow from label to blue region clarifies which area corresponds to the 24 value.\n\n\n\nDecision: Explicit visual decomposition of monopoly gain Rationale: Visual arithmetic was opaque. Blue shaded area = 34, but Δπ^m = 24. Students confused by discrepancy. The lost profit strip (when price drops from P^m(c₀)=15 to P^m(c₁)=13) was implicit. Making it explicit with darker red + “lost: 10” label shows: gain = +34 (blue) - 10 (dark red) = 24. Pedagogically essential for understanding replacement effect.\n\n\n\nDecision: Add “Timing/game structure” paragraph Rationale: Game theory students expect explicit extensive form or at minimum statement of timing. Setup showed payoffs but not game structure. Is innovation choice simultaneous? Sequential? Is this a Nash equilibrium in R&D spending? Clarifying that we’re comparing WTP (as in auction/race) and entry happens post-allocation removes ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModified TikZ source files\nRan python scripts/tikz2pdf.py to regenerate SVGs\nRan quarto render lecture-3-innovation.qmd --to pdf (SUCCESS)\nRan quarto render lecture-3-innovation.qmd --to html (SUCCESS)\nVerified all figures display correctly in both outputs\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto 1.9.19 Windows bug: “Program Files” path not quoted in Dart SASS compiler. Doesn’t block HTML render in this case, but may fail on other machines.\nRecommendation: Reinstall Quarto to C:\\Quarto\\ (no spaces) or create junction C:\\Program → C:\\Program Files as admin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduce callout box count from 19 to ~12 by demoting “Interpretation” and “Goal” boxes to plain italic text (reduce box fatigue)\nAdd D-S comparative statics figure showing 1/N* vs α (visual support for abstract result)\nMove diagrams before algebra for drastic innovation and replacement effect slides (visual-first principle)\nAdd YAML format block to QMD header matching lecture-2 structure (reproducibility)\n\nPriority: LOW - lecture is teaching-ready as-is\n\n\n\n\nStatus: ✓ COMPLETE Quality: EXCELLENT Teaching-Ready: YES\nAll critical and major issues resolved. Lecture demonstrates strong pedagogical structure with: - Early engagement (Socratic question at 32% instead of 54%) - Clear notation (α defined before use) - Explicit assumptions (Cournot, timing, game structure) - De-densified theory (intuition breaks, split derivation) - Visual clarity (fixed overlaps, added labels, connected annotations) - Historical context (Industrial Revolution → economic growth)\nThe lecture now provides a rigorous, well-paced progression from motivation → benchmarks → strategic models → general framework, suitable for MSc-level instruction.\n\n\n\n\nTask: Fix quality reports directory configuration for proper subdirectory organization\n\n\n\nPlans and session logs were not being written to their proper subdirectories (quality_reports/plans/ and quality_reports/session_logs/)\n2 agents (slide-auditor, tikz-reviewer) lacked explicit save path instructions\nNo agents had guidance on appending to session logs during work (Rule 5b behavior)\n\n\n\n\nFiles Modified: 8 agent definition files\n\nAdded “## Save the Report” sections (2 agents):\n\n.claude/agents/slide-auditor.md → quality_reports/[FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXT]_visual_audit.md\n.claude/agents/tikz-reviewer.md → quality_reports/[FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXT]_tikz_review.md\n\nAdded “## Session Log Integration” sections (all 8 agents):\n\nproofreader.md\npedagogy-reviewer.md\nquarto-critic.md\nquarto-fixer.md\nr-reviewer.md\ndomain-reviewer.md\nslide-auditor.md\ntikz-reviewer.md\n\n\nEach section includes: - Instruction to check for session log file in quality_reports/session_logs/ matching today’s date - Format template for appending brief entries when critical issues are found - Rationale: maintain continuous record of decisions and fixes throughout session\n\n\n\n\nAgents now have explicit, consistent save paths for all reports\nSession logging behavior is now proactive and documented (Rule 5b compliance)\nThree-tier organization maintained:\n\nquality_reports/ → review reports (proofreader, auditor, etc.)\nquality_reports/plans/ → implementation plans\nquality_reports/session_logs/ → session work logs\n\n\nStatus: ✓ COMPLETE Next Step: Test agents to verify they write to correct subdirectories"

    "text": "Decision: Two-slide split (Setup + Solution) Rationale: 5 algebraic steps on one slide violates Pattern 7 (two-slide strategy for dense theorems). Students need time to process α introduction, substitution logic, and final formula. Splitting allows forward pointer, labeled intermediate steps with \\underbrace{}, and clearer pedagogical progression.\n\n\n\nDecision: New discussion slide after monopoly benchmark Rationale: Connects abstract IO theory to “why it matters” big picture (economic growth). Motivates the monopoly vs competition comparison that follows. Breaks passive first half - students engage with ideas before seeing formal proofs. Aligns with pedagogy-reviewer recommendation for early Socratic embedding.\n\n\n\nDecision: Show \\(\\alpha = -\\frac{dc(x)}{dx}\\frac{x}{c}\\) in table, not just description Rationale: α appears in derivation (line 467: “\\(\\frac{x}{cq} = \\alpha\\)”) before formal definition (line 470). Students were confused about where this relationship came from. Including formula in notation table (line 382) establishes it upfront.\n\n\n\nDecision: Vague label removed, quantified label connected Rationale: “gain” provides no information (what gain? how much?). The quantified “\\(\\Delta\\pi^m = 24\\)” label was already present but floating disconnected. Following visual quality rules, annotations should connect to the elements they describe. Arrow from label to blue region clarifies which area corresponds to the 24 value.\n\n\n\nDecision: Explicit visual decomposition of monopoly gain Rationale: Visual arithmetic was opaque. Blue shaded area = 34, but Δπ^m = 24. Students confused by discrepancy. The lost profit strip (when price drops from P^m(c₀)=15 to P^m(c₁)=13) was implicit. Making it explicit with darker red + “lost: 10” label shows: gain = +34 (blue) - 10 (dark red) = 24. Pedagogically essential for understanding replacement effect.\n\n\n\nDecision: Add “Timing/game structure” paragraph Rationale: Game theory students expect explicit extensive form or at minimum statement of timing. Setup showed payoffs but not game structure. Is innovation choice simultaneous? Sequential? Is this a Nash equilibrium in R&D spending? Clarifying that we’re comparing WTP (as in auction/race) and entry happens post-allocation removes ambiguity."

Only on c.\nWith quadratic costs:\n∂q₁/∂p₁ = -1/(2td)\nThe slope DOES depend on d.\nEconomic logic: - Smaller d → firms closer → steeper utility penalty for mismatch → more elastic demand → fiercer price competition → lower markups - In location stage, extreme differentiation (d large) less attractive because it softens price competition too much - With linear costs, demand slope independent of d → location incentives distorted → “principle of minimum differentiation” breakdown\nVerification: ✅ ECONOMICALLY SOUND and mathematically accurate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation: Part (a) solution, line 117\nCurrent: “Expanding (or using \\((x-a)^2-(1-a-x)^2=(1-2a)(2x-1)=d(2x-1)\\)) gives …”\nAnalysis: The solution provides the factored form \\((x-a)^2-(1-a-x)^2=(1-2a)(2x-1)\\) without showing the expansion.

Only on c.\nWith quadratic costs:\n∂q₁/∂p₁ = -1/(2td)\nThe slope DOES depend on d.\nEconomic logic: - Smaller d → firms closer → steeper utility penalty for mismatch → more elastic demand → fiercer price competition → lower markups - In location stage, extreme differentiation (d large) less attractive because it softens price competition too much - With linear costs, demand slope independent of d → location incentives distorted → “principle of minimum differentiation” breakdown\nVerification: ✅ ECONOMICALLY SOUND and mathematically accurate"

    "text": "If you’ve ever built lecture slides, you know the pain:\n\nContext loss between sessions. You pick up where you left off, but Claude doesn’t remember why you chose that notation, what the instructor approved, or which bugs were fixed last time.\nQuality is inconsistent. One slide has perfect spacing; the next overflows. Citations compile in Overleaf but break locally. Figures look great on your screen but pixelated on a projector.\nReview is manual and exhausting. You proofread 140 slides by hand. You miss a typo in an equation. A student catches it during lecture.\nNo one checks the math. Grammar checkers catch “teh” but not a flipped sign in a decomposition theorem.\n\nThis workflow solves all of these problems.

You proofread 140 slides by hand. You miss a typo in an equation. A student catches it during lecture.\nNo one checks the math.

(up to 5 rounds)\nWhy it works: The critic can’t fix files (read-only), so it has no incentive to downplay issues. The fixer can’t approve itself (the critic re-audits).

The fixer replaced it. On re-audit, the critic found 8 more instances of missing (X) arguments on outcome models. After 4 rounds, the Quarto slides matched the Beamer source exactly."

That is the orchestrator’s job.\nThe orchestrator protocol (.claude/rules/orchestrator-protocol.md) is an auto-loaded rule that activates after any plan is approved. It implements the plan, runs the verifier, selects review agents based on file types, applies fixes, re-verifies, and scores against quality gates. It loops until the score meets threshold or max rounds are exhausted.\nYou never invoke the orchestrator manually — it is the default mode of operation for any non-trivial task. Skills remain available for standalone use (e.g., /proofread for a quick grammar check), but the orchestrator handles the full lifecycle automatically. See Pattern 2 for the complete workflow."

    "text": "5.1 Pattern 1: Plan-First Development\nThe plan-first pattern ensures that non-trivial tasks begin with thinking, not typing.\n\n5.1.1 Why Planning Matters\nThe most common failure mode in AI-assisted development is not bad code — it is solving the wrong problem, or solving the right problem in a fragile order. Plan-first development forces an explicit design step before any file is touched.\nWithout a plan:\n\nClaude starts editing immediately, discovers a dependency on slide 3 that changes the approach, and has to undo work\nContext compression discards the reasoning behind a design choice, and Claude makes a contradictory decision later\nThe user and Claude have different mental models of what “done” looks like\n\nWith a plan:\n\nThe approach is agreed upon before any edits happen\nThe plan is saved to disk, so it survives compression and session boundaries\nImplementation has a checklist to follow, reducing drift\n\n\n\n5.1.2 The Protocol\nNon-trivial task arrives\n  |\n  +-- Step 1: Enter Plan Mode (EnterPlanMode)\n  +-- Step 2: Draft plan (approach, files, verification)\n  +-- Step 3: Save to quality_reports/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md\n  +-- Step 4: Present plan to user\n  +-- Step 5: User approves (or revises)\n  +-- Step 6: Save initial session log (capture context while fresh)\n  +-- Step 7: Orchestrator takes over (see Pattern 2)\n  +-- Step 8: Update session log + plan status to COMPLETED\n\n\n5.1.3 Context Preservation: Never /clear\nAn important companion to plan-first development is context preservation. Claude Code has two ways to free context space:\n\n/clear — destroys everything. All context, corrections, and reasoning are gone. Starting over from zero.\nAuto-compression — Claude Code automatically compresses the conversation when it gets long. It keeps the most important context and discards redundant detail. This is graceful degradation.\n\nThe rule is simple: never use /clear. Let auto-compression do its job. And as a safety net, always save plans and important decisions to files on disk, where they cannot be compressed away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecovery After Compression\n\n\n\nIf you notice Claude has lost context after auto-compression, point it to the saved plan file:\n\n“Read quality_reports/plans/2026-02-06_translate-lecture5.md — that’s our current plan.”\n\nBecause the plan is on disk, recovery is instant.\n\n\nCombined with the [LEARN] tag system from Pattern 7, plans and context preservation form a complete memory layer: plans save task strategy, [LEARN] tags save corrections, and auto-compression keeps the conversation manageable without losing what matters.\n\n\n5.1.4 Session Logging\nSession logs (quality_reports/session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md) are a running record of why things happened. They have three distinct behaviors, each solving a different problem:\nAfter plan approval — create the log with the goal, plan summary, and rationale for the chosen approach (including rejected alternatives). This captures decisions while context is richest. If you wait, auto-compression may discard the reasoning.\nDuring implementation — append to the log as you work. Every time a design decision is made, a problem is discovered, or the approach deviates from the plan, write a 1-3 line entry immediately. This is the most important behavior: context gets compressed as the session progresses, and decisions that live only in the conversation will be lost.\nAt session end — add a final section with what was accomplished, open questions, and unresolved issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGit Records What, Session Logs Record Why\n\n\n\nA commit message says “Update Lecture 5 TikZ diagrams.” A session log says “Redesigned the TWFE decomposition diagram because the DA challenge revealed students couldn’t trace the path from weights to bias. Considered a table format but chose a flow diagram because it shows directionality.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantWhy Incremental Logging Matters\n\n\n\nThe post-plan log is a special case — it fires once, right after approval. But the incremental logging during implementation is what truly protects you. A 4-hour session that only logs at the start and end loses everything in the middle. Appending decisions as they happen means auto-compression can never erase them — they are already on disk.\n\n\nClaude writes all three log entries automatically — no need to ask."

    "section": "5.2 Pattern 2: Contractor Mode (Orchestrator)",
    "text": "5.2 Pattern 2: Contractor Mode (Orchestrator)\nOnce a plan is approved, the orchestrator takes over. It is the natural continuation of Pattern 1: the plan says what, the orchestrator handles how — autonomously.\n\n5.2.1 The Mental Model\nThink of the orchestrator as a general contractor. You are the client. You describe what you want. The plan-first protocol is the blueprint phase. Once you approve the blueprint, the contractor takes over: hires the right specialists (agents), inspects their work (verification), sends them back to fix issues (review-fix loop), and only calls you when the job passes inspection (quality gates).\n\n\n5.2.2 The Loop\nUser: \"Translate Lecture 5 to Quarto\"\n  |\n  |-- Plan-first (Pattern 1): draft plan, save to disk, get approval\n  |\n  |-- User: \"Approved\"\n  |\n  +-- Orchestrator activates:\n        |\n        Step 1: IMPLEMENT\n        |  Execute plan steps (create QMD, translate content, etc.)\n        |\n        Step 2: VERIFY\n        |  Run verifier: render Quarto, check HTML output\n        |  If render fails -&gt; fix -&gt; re-render\n        |\n        Step 3: REVIEW (agents selected by file type)\n        |  +--- proofreader ------+\n        |  +--- slide-auditor ----+  (parallel)\n        |  +--- pedagogy-reviewer +\n        |  +--- quarto-critic ----+  (needs others first)\n        |\n        Step 4: FIX\n        |  Apply fixes: Critical -&gt; Major -&gt; Minor\n        |  For quarto-critic issues: invoke quarto-fixer\n        |\n        Step 5: RE-VERIFY\n        |  Render again, confirm fixes are clean\n        |\n        Step 6: SCORE\n        |  Apply quality-gates rubric\n        |\n        +-- Score &gt;= 80?\n              YES -&gt; Present summary to user\n              NO  -&gt; Loop to Step 3 (max 5 rounds)\n\n\n5.2.3 Agent Selection\nThe orchestrator selects agents based on which files were touched:\n\n\n\nFiles Modified\nAgents Selected\n\n\n\n\n.tex only\nproofreader + slide-auditor + pedagogy-reviewer\n\n\n.qmd only\nproofreader + slide-auditor + pedagogy-reviewer\n\n\n.qmd with matching .tex\nAbove + quarto-critic (parity check)\n\n\n.R scripts\nr-reviewer\n\n\nTikZ diagrams present\ntikz-reviewer\n\n\nDomain content\ndomain-reviewer (if configured)\n\n\nMultiple formats\nverifier for cross-format parity\n\n\n\nAgents that are independent of each other run in parallel. The quarto-critic runs after other agents because it may need their context.\n\n\n5.2.4 “Just Do It” Mode\nSometimes you do not want to approve the final result — you just want it done:\n\n“Translate Lecture 5 to Quarto. Just do it.”\n\nIn this mode, the orchestrator still runs the full verify-review-fix loop (quality is non-negotiable), but skips the final approval pause and auto-commits if the score is 80 or above. It still presents the summary so you can see what was done.\n\n\n5.2.5 Relationship to Existing Skills\nThe orchestrator does NOT replace skills. It coordinates them:\n\n/qa-quarto remains available as a standalone adversarial QA loop\n/slide-excellence remains available for comprehensive multi-agent review\n/create-lecture remains available as a guided creation workflow\n\nThe difference: when you invoke a skill directly, it runs its specific workflow. When the orchestrator is active, it decides which agents to invoke based on context. The orchestrator is the default; skills are for targeted use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhen to Use Skills vs. the Orchestrator\n\n\n\nOrchestrator (automatic): “Translate Lecture 5 to Quarto” — the orchestrator figures out the agents.\nSkill (explicit): “/qa-quarto Lecture5” — you specifically want the adversarial critic-fixer loop, nothing else.\nBoth are valid. The orchestrator is the “I trust you, handle it” path. Skills are the “I know exactly what I want” path."

Labels positioned inside colored fills are nearly invisible when projected. Arrow direction inconsistencies create pedagogical confusion. These must be fixed before deployment.\nRecommendation: 1. Fix all 3 critical label positioning issues immediately 2. Fix arrow direction in inverted-U diagram (pedagogically important) 3. Re-run /tikz-reviewer after fixes to verify 4.

The deck follows 10/13 required patterns, with only one pattern violation (fragment reveals, which is already flagged for removal). The narrative arc is clear and well-paced, notation is consistent, worked examples follow definitions, and Socratic questions are well-embedded (5 instances, exceeding the 2-3 target).\nKey Strengths: - Strong narrative progression: motivation → benchmarks → extensions → general model - Excellent two-slide strategy for D-S derivation (prevents cognitive overload) - Consistent notation with full definition table (including complex α elasticity) - Pre-emptive student support (forward pointers, assumption statements) - 5 well-placed discussion questions engage students at key decision points\nComparison to Previous Review: The 2026-02-08 fixes successfully addressed all critical and major pedagogical issues from the 2026-02-07 review.

Citations are correctly formatted using @key (narrative) or [@key] (parenthetical) syntax, with one exception: line 428 contains both a hardcoded “Acemoglu and Linn (2004)” AND a citation key, creating redundancy.\nQuality Impact: -10 points (Major severity)\nFix Required: - Line 428: Replace Acemoglu and Linn (2004) show that ...

No major grammar errors or typos detected.\nPriority Fixes: 1. Remove prohibited fragment (line 540) — already flagged as critical 2. Fix malformed section header (line 375) 3. Fix double-space typo (line 377) 4. Rephrase awkward citation construction (line 379) 5. Review derivation slide (lines 518-534) for overflow\nComparison to Previous Review: - Previous report (2026-02-07): 15 issues (2 high, 5 medium, 8 low) - Current report (2026-02-09): 11 issues (1 high, 5 medium, 5 low)\nThe file quality has improved substantially. Most overflow and consistency issues have been addressed.\nFull Report: quality_reports/lecture-3-innovation_report.md\n\n\n\n\nStatus: GOOD (one fix required)\n\nCritical: 0\nMedium: 1 (hardcoded citation with redundant key)\nLow: 0\n\nSummary: All 8 unique citation keys have matching bibliography entries. Citations are correctly formatted using @key (narrative) or [@key] (parenthetical) syntax, with one exception: line 428 contains both a hardcoded “Acemoglu and Linn (2004)” AND a citation key, creating redundancy.\nQuality Impact: -10 points (Major severity)\nFix Required: - Line 428: Replace Acemoglu and Linn (2004) show that ... [@acemogluMarketSizeInnovation2004] - With: @acemogluMarketSizeInnovation2004 show that ...\nThis change maintains identical rendered output while enabling proper automated bibliography management.\nExempt Instances: One author-year pattern in fig-alt text (line 228) is correctly exempt from this rule.\nFull Report: quality_reports/lecture-3-innovation_citation_audit.md"

However, the Dasgupta-Stiglitz model (lines 330–415) introduces the planner problem, FOC, free-entry condition, and concentration formula across four consecutive slides with no numerical example. Comparative statics (lines 417–451) also lack worked examples.\n\n\n\nZero fragment reveals (. . .) in the entire deck. Key “punchline” moments that should be revealed after a pause: - Replacement effect inequality: \\(\\Delta \\pi^{pc} - \\Delta \\pi^m = \\pi^m(c_0) &gt; 0\\) - Pre-emption condition: \\(V_I &gt; V_E\\) - D-S concentration formula\n\n\n\nThe free-entry/concentration slide (lines 387–415) crams four equations plus an interpretation callout onto a single slide. This is the densest slide in the deck.\n\n\n\nThe perfect competition benchmark slide (lines 124–164) contains two callout boxes plus equations and the drastic condition. ~54% of slides have at least one callout overall.\n\n\n\nOnly one discussion question in the deck (line 239–241).

Only on c.\nWith quadratic costs:\n∂q₁/∂p₁ = -1/(2td)\nThe slope DOES depend on d.\nEconomic logic: - Smaller d → firms closer → steeper utility penalty for mismatch → more elastic demand → fiercer price competition → lower markups - In location stage, extreme differentiation (d large) less attractive because it softens price competition too much - With linear costs, demand slope independent of d → location incentives distorted → “principle of minimum differentiation” breakdown\nVerification: ✅ ECONOMICALLY SOUND and mathematically accurate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation: Part (a) solution, line 117\nCurrent: “Expanding (or using \\((x-a)^2-(1-a-x)^2=(1-2a)(2x-1)=d(2x-1)\\)) gives …”\nAnalysis: The solution provides the factored form \\((x-a)^2-(1-a-x)^2=(1-2a)(2x-1)\\) without showing the expansion. While this is correct (verified above), some students may struggle to verify it.\nImpact: LOW (advanced students can verify; others can accept the identity and proceed)\nRecommendation: Add one line showing the expansion for completeness:\nExpanding: (x-a)² - (1-a-x)² = (x²-2ax+a²) - ((1-a)²-2(1-a)x+x²) = (1-2a)(2x-1) = d(2x-1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart\nAlgebraic Correctness\nNumerical Accuracy\nEconomic Logic\nIntermediate Steps\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n✓ Correct\nN/A\n✓ Sound\n✓ Adequate\nCORRECT\n\n\n(b)\n✓ Correct\nN/A\n✓ Sound\n✓ Good\nCORRECT\n\n\n(c)\n✓ Correct\nN/A\n✓ Sound\n✓ Good\nCORRECT\n\n\n(d)\n✓ Correct\nN/A\n✓ Sound\n✓ Adequate\nCORRECT\n\n\n(e)\n✓ Correct\n✓ All correct\nN/A\n✓ Clear\nCORRECT\n\n\n(f)\nN/A\nN/A\n✓ Sound\n✓ Clear\nCORRECT\n\n\n\nOverall: ✅ CORRECT — All solutions verified mathematically accurate\n\n\n\n\nAll key derivations were independently reproduced: 1.

Only on c.\nWith quadratic costs:\n∂q₁/∂p₁ = -1/(2td)\nThe slope DOES depend on d.\nEconomic logic: - Smaller d → firms closer → steeper utility penalty for mismatch → more elastic demand → fiercer price competition → lower markups - In location stage, extreme differentiation (d large) less attractive because it softens price competition too much - With linear costs, demand slope independent of d → location incentives distorted → “principle of minimum differentiation” breakdown\nVerification: ✅ ECONOMICALLY SOUND and mathematically accurate"

    "text": "Problem: 6 sub-questions (a-f) is excessive for a 20-minute exercise.\nEvidence: - Even skipping optional (d), estimated time is 22-30 min - With (d), exercise takes 28-36 min (up to 80% over target)\nImpact: Students will rush final parts or not finish, reducing learning value\nRecommended Fix (choose one):\nOption A (Remove numerical/discussion): - Keep (a), (b), (c), (d-optional) - Remove (e) and (f) - New total: 18-23 min ✓ GOOD\nOption B (Make more optional): - Required: (a), (b), (c) only - Optional: (d), (e), (f) labeled “if time permits” - Core total: 18-23 min ✓ GOOD\nOption C (Simplify part c): - Combine “show price gap” and “discuss distance” into one question - Keep (a), (b), (c-simplified), (e) - Remove (d) and (f) - New total: ~18-22 min ✓ GOOD\n\n\n\n\nProblem: Part (c) has 4 distinct tasks: 1. Solve equilibrium 2. Compute shares 3. Show price gap formula 4. Discuss distance effect\nEvidence: Estimated 8-9 minutes for one “part” is high\nImpact: May feel overwhelming; students might not finish all tasks\nRecommended Fix: Split into (c) and (c’) or simplify: - (c) Solve for (p₁, p₂) and (q₁, q₂) - (c’) Show that p₂* - p₁* = (c₂-c₁)/3 and explain how distance affects markups\nThis makes progression clearer and allows partial credit.\n\n\n\n\nProblem: Part (a) immediately requires nontrivial algebra (expanding quadratics, factoring)\nEvidence: Part (a) is 4-6 minutes, which is appropriate for a main derivation but quick for a warm-up\nImpact: Groups may struggle to get started, eating into time for later parts\nRecommended Fix (optional): Add a sub-part (a.0) before current (a): - (a.0) “Write down the utility functions for a consumer at location x buying from Firm 1 and Firm 2.” [1 min] - Then proceed to current (a)\nThis gives students a moment to orient before tackling the algebra."
