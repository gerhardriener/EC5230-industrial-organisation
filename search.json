Emphasise that the replacement effect, the appropriability gap, and the private-vs-social wedge all point in the same direction: without intervention, private R&D incentives are too weak.\nPose the question on the slide as a genuine open problem: IPRs are one response, but they come with their own costs. This sets up the central trade-off that runs through the entire lecture.",

(up to 5 rounds)\nWhy it works: The critic can’t fix files (read-only), so it has no incentive to downplay issues. The fixer can’t approve itself (the critic re-audits). This prevents the common failure of Claude saying “looks good” about its own work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipReal Example\n\n\n\nIn Econ 730 Lecture 6, the critic caught that the Quarto version used \\cdots (a placeholder) where the Beamer version had the full Hajek weight formula. The fixer replaced it. On re-audit, the critic found 8 more instances of missing (X) arguments on outcome models. After 4 rounds, the Quarto slides matched the Beamer source exactly."

    "text": "2.3 The Orchestrator: Coordinating Agents Automatically\nIndividual agents are specialists. Skills like /slide-excellence and /qa-quarto coordinate a few agents for specific tasks. But in day-to-day work, you should not have to think about which agents to run. That is the orchestrator’s job.\nThe orchestrator protocol (.claude/rules/orchestrator-protocol.md) is an auto-loaded rule that activates after any plan is approved. It implements the plan, runs the verifier, selects review agents based on file types, applies fixes, re-verifies, and scores against quality gates. It loops until the score meets threshold or max rounds are exhausted.\nYou never invoke the orchestrator manually — it is the default mode of operation for any non-trivial task. Skills remain available for standalone use (e.g., /proofread for a quick grammar check), but the orchestrator handles the full lifecycle automatically. See Pattern 2 for the complete workflow."

Every non-trivial plan is saved to quality_reports/plans/ with a timestamp.

This means the log captures reasoning as it happens, before auto-compression can discard it.\nNew sessions can read these logs to understand not just the current state of the project, but the reasoning behind it.

    "text": "5.1 Pattern 1: Plan-First Development\nThe plan-first pattern ensures that non-trivial tasks begin with thinking, not typing.\n\n5.1.1 Why Planning Matters\nThe most common failure mode in AI-assisted development is not bad code — it is solving the wrong problem, or solving the right problem in a fragile order. Plan-first development forces an explicit design step before any file is touched.\nWithout a plan:\n\nClaude starts editing immediately, discovers a dependency on slide 3 that changes the approach, and has to undo work\nContext compression discards the reasoning behind a design choice, and Claude makes a contradictory decision later\nThe user and Claude have different mental models of what “done” looks like\n\nWith a plan:\n\nThe approach is agreed upon before any edits happen\nThe plan is saved to disk, so it survives compression and session boundaries\nImplementation has a checklist to follow, reducing drift\n\n\n\n5.1.2 The Protocol\nNon-trivial task arrives\n  |\n  +-- Step 1: Enter Plan Mode (EnterPlanMode)\n  +-- Step 2: Draft plan (approach, files, verification)\n  +-- Step 3: Save to quality_reports/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md\n  +-- Step 4: Present plan to user\n  +-- Step 5: User approves (or revises)\n  +-- Step 6: Save initial session log (capture context while fresh)\n  +-- Step 7: Orchestrator takes over (see Pattern 2)\n  +-- Step 8: Update session log + plan status to COMPLETED\n\n\n5.1.3 Context Preservation: Never /clear\nAn important companion to plan-first development is context preservation. Claude Code has two ways to free context space:\n\n/clear — destroys everything. All context, corrections, and reasoning are gone. Starting over from zero.\nAuto-compression — Claude Code automatically compresses the conversation when it gets long. It keeps the most important context and discards redundant detail. This is graceful degradation.\n\nThe rule is simple: never use /clear. Let auto-compression do its job. And as a safety net, always save plans and important decisions to files on disk, where they cannot be compressed away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecovery After Compression\n\n\n\nIf you notice Claude has lost context after auto-compression, point it to the saved plan file:\n\n“Read quality_reports/plans/2026-02-06_translate-lecture5.md — that’s our current plan.”\n\nBecause the plan is on disk, recovery is instant.\n\n\nCombined with the [LEARN] tag system from Pattern 7, plans and context preservation form a complete memory layer: plans save task strategy, [LEARN] tags save corrections, and auto-compression keeps the conversation manageable without losing what matters.\n\n\n5.1.4 Session Logging\nSession logs (quality_reports/session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md) are a running record of why things happened. They have three distinct behaviors, each solving a different problem:\nAfter plan approval — create the log with the goal, plan summary, and rationale for the chosen approach (including rejected alternatives). This captures decisions while context is richest. If you wait, auto-compression may discard the reasoning.\nDuring implementation — append to the log as you work. Every time a design decision is made, a problem is discovered, or the approach deviates from the plan, write a 1-3 line entry immediately. This is the most important behavior: context gets compressed as the session progresses, and decisions that live only in the conversation will be lost.\nAt session end — add a final section with what was accomplished, open questions, and unresolved issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGit Records What, Session Logs Record Why\n\n\n\nA commit message says “Update Lecture 5 TikZ diagrams.” A session log says “Redesigned the TWFE decomposition diagram because the DA challenge revealed students couldn’t trace the path from weights to bias. Considered a table format but chose a flow diagram because it shows directionality.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantWhy Incremental Logging Matters\n\n\n\nThe post-plan log is a special case — it fires once, right after approval. But the incremental logging during implementation is what truly protects you. A 4-hour session that only logs at the start and end loses everything in the middle. Appending decisions as they happen means auto-compression can never erase them — they are already on disk.\n\n\nClaude writes all three log entries automatically — no need to ask."

    "section": "5.2 Pattern 2: Contractor Mode (Orchestrator)",
    "text": "5.2 Pattern 2: Contractor Mode (Orchestrator)\nOnce a plan is approved, the orchestrator takes over. It is the natural continuation of Pattern 1: the plan says what, the orchestrator handles how — autonomously.\n\n5.2.1 The Mental Model\nThink of the orchestrator as a general contractor. You are the client. You describe what you want. The plan-first protocol is the blueprint phase. Once you approve the blueprint, the contractor takes over: hires the right specialists (agents), inspects their work (verification), sends them back to fix issues (review-fix loop), and only calls you when the job passes inspection (quality gates).\n\n\n5.2.2 The Loop\nUser: \"Translate Lecture 5 to Quarto\"\n  |\n  |-- Plan-first (Pattern 1): draft plan, save to disk, get approval\n  |\n  |-- User: \"Approved\"\n  |\n  +-- Orchestrator activates:\n        |\n        Step 1: IMPLEMENT\n        |  Execute plan steps (create QMD, translate content, etc.)\n        |\n        Step 2: VERIFY\n        |  Run verifier: render Quarto, check HTML output\n        |  If render fails -&gt; fix -&gt; re-render\n        |\n        Step 3: REVIEW (agents selected by file type)\n        |  +--- proofreader ------+\n        |  +--- slide-auditor ----+  (parallel)\n        |  +--- pedagogy-reviewer +\n        |  +--- quarto-critic ----+  (needs others first)\n        |\n        Step 4: FIX\n        |  Apply fixes: Critical -&gt; Major -&gt; Minor\n        |  For quarto-critic issues: invoke quarto-fixer\n        |\n        Step 5: RE-VERIFY\n        |  Render again, confirm fixes are clean\n        |\n        Step 6: SCORE\n        |  Apply quality-gates rubric\n        |\n        +-- Score &gt;= 80?\n              YES -&gt; Present summary to user\n              NO  -&gt; Loop to Step 3 (max 5 rounds)\n\n\n5.2.3 Agent Selection\nThe orchestrator selects agents based on which files were touched:\n\n\n\nFiles Modified\nAgents Selected\n\n\n\n\n.tex only\nproofreader + slide-auditor + pedagogy-reviewer\n\n\n.qmd only\nproofreader + slide-auditor + pedagogy-reviewer\n\n\n.qmd with matching .tex\nAbove + quarto-critic (parity check)\n\n\n.R scripts\nr-reviewer\n\n\nTikZ diagrams present\ntikz-reviewer\n\n\nDomain content\ndomain-reviewer (if configured)\n\n\nMultiple formats\nverifier for cross-format parity\n\n\n\nAgents that are independent of each other run in parallel. The quarto-critic runs after other agents because it may need their context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantHard Rule: Don’t Double-Run Full Review Stacks in Orchestrator Mode\n\n\n\nOnce a plan is approved, you are in orchestrator mode: the orchestrator already runs the standard review agents (proofreader + slide-auditor + pedagogy-reviewer) as part of its verify–review–fix loop.\nDo not manually run a second full review stack (e.g., /slide-excellence, or stacking /proofread + /visual-audit + /pedagogy-review) on the same revision unless you are intentionally doing a milestone audit to capture an independent review snapshot.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 “Just Do It” Mode\nSometimes you do not want to approve the final result — you just want it done:\n\n“Translate Lecture 5 to Quarto. Just do it.”\n\nIn this mode, the orchestrator still runs the full verify-review-fix loop (quality is non-negotiable), but skips the final approval pause and auto-commits if the score is 80 or above. It still presents the summary so you can see what was done.\n\n\n5.2.5 Relationship to Existing Skills\nThe orchestrator does NOT replace skills. It coordinates them:\n\n/qa-quarto remains available as a standalone adversarial QA loop\n/slide-excellence remains available for comprehensive multi-agent review\n/create-lecture remains available as a guided creation workflow\n\nThe difference: when you invoke a skill directly, it runs its specific workflow. When the orchestrator is active, it decides which agents to invoke based on context. The orchestrator is the default; skills are for targeted use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhen to Use Skills vs. the Orchestrator\n\n\n\nOrchestrator (automatic): “Translate Lecture 5 to Quarto” — the orchestrator figures out the agents.\nSkill (explicit): “/qa-quarto Lecture5” — you specifically want the adversarial critic-fixer loop, nothing else.\nBoth are valid. The orchestrator is the “I trust you, handle it” path. Skills are the “I know exactly what I want” path."

    "text": "6.5 Tips from 6+ Sessions of Iteration\n\nStart with CLAUDE.md. It’s the foundation. Spend 30 minutes making it thorough.\nAdd rules incrementally. Don’t try to write all rules upfront. Add them when you discover patterns.\nUse the [LEARN] format. Every correction Pedro made was tagged and persisted. This prevents repeating mistakes.\nTrust the adversarial pattern. The critic-fixer loop catches things you won’t. Let it run.\nVerify everything. The Stop hook exists for a reason. Never skip verification.\nSession logs matter. Document design decisions, not just what changed. Future-you will thank present-you.\nDevil’s Advocate early. Challenge slide structure before you’ve built 50 slides on a shaky foundation."
