## Welcome

This is the course website for **EC5230 Industrial Organisation** at the University of St Andrews.

Industrial Organisation studies the structure of firms and markets, strategic interactions between firms, and the effects of market power on economic outcomes. This course covers both theoretical foundations and practical applications, examining how firms behave in imperfectly competitive markets.

## Course Overview

**Module Credits:** 15 (Semester 2, Optional)

### Topics Covered

This module explores key concepts in industrial economics across twelve weeks:

- **Competition and Oligopoly Coordination** (Week 1)
- **Product Differentiation** (Week 2)
- **Economics of Innovation** (Week 3)
- **Economics of Patents and IPRs** (Week 4)
- **Multi-stage Games** (Week 5)
- **Cooperative R&D** (Week 7)
- **Bundling** (Week 8)
- **Advertising** (Week 9)
- **Mergers** (Week 11)
- **Sustainable Industrialisation** (Week 12)

### Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, you will be able to:

- Understand how Industrial Organisation deepens the analysis of firm behaviour in imperfectly competitive markets
- Select and apply appropriate models to analyse various issues in industrial economics
- Develop skills in analysing economic behaviour through game theory
- Identify and critically evaluate relevant research papers and real-world examples

### Sustainability in the Curriculum

This module contributes to UN Sustainable Development Goals:

- **Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure** — Examining how patents and IPRs impact innovation disclosure and cooperative R&D
- **Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** — Analysing network effects in technology adoption and sustainable industrialisation
