## Problem: Replacement effect and social value

A pharmaceutical company has discovered a new manufacturing process (*Tech P*) that reduces the marginal cost of producing a drug from $c_0 = 60$ to $c_1 = 30$.
Market demand for the drug is

$$
P(Q) = 100 - Q.
$$

Assume Tech P is available exclusively to the one firm that acquires it (patent protection is perfect).

### (a) Is the innovation drastic?

Use the monopoly pricing formula to determine whether Tech P is **drastic** or **non-drastic**. State the condition and evaluate it numerically.

*Recall: a process innovation is drastic if $P^m(c_1) < c_0$, where $P^m(c) = \tfrac{A+c}{2}$ under linear demand $P = A - Q$.*

### (b) Monopoly and competitive WTP

Compute the **maximum willingness to pay** (WTP) for Tech P of:

1. a **monopolist** (not threatened by entry)
2. a **competitive innovator** — a firm that operates in a competitive market before acquiring the patent, then gains exclusive rights to Tech P

*Hint for (2): use your result from (a) to determine whether the competitive innovator limit-prices at $p = c_0$ after acquiring the patent.*

### (c) Social planner's value

For linear demand $P = A - Q$ with efficient production (price equals marginal cost), total surplus is $W(c) = \tfrac{(A-c)^2}{2}$.

1. Compute the social planner's value of the innovation, $\Delta W = W(c_1) - W(c_0)$.
2. Arrange the three values — $\Delta\pi^m$, competitive WTP, $\Delta W$ — in increasing order.
3. State Arrow's replacement effect in one sentence. Using the numbers from (b), explain what drives the gap between $\Delta\pi^m$ and the competitive WTP. Why is $\Delta W$ larger than both?

## Solution

### (a) Drastic or non-drastic?

With $P(Q) = 100 - Q$ and $c_1 = 30$, the post-innovation monopoly price is

$$
P^m(c_1) = \frac{A + c_1}{2} = \frac{100 + 30}{2} = 65.
$$

Since $P^m(c_1) = 65 > c_0 = 60$, the innovation is **non-drastic**.

Intuitively, even with the lower cost, the monopolist would price above the competitive benchmark — so the innovation does not completely destroy the competitive fringe.

### (b) Monopoly and competitive WTP

#### Monopoly WTP

**Pre-innovation** ($c_0 = 60$):

$$
\max_Q (100 - Q - 60)Q = \max_Q (40 - Q)Q.
$$

FOC: $40 - 2Q = 0 \Rightarrow Q_0^m = 20$, $P_0^m = 80$,

$$
\pi_0^m = (80 - 60)\times 20 = 400.
$$

**Post-innovation** ($c_1 = 30$):

$$
\max_Q (70 - Q)Q. \quad \text{FOC: } 70 - 2Q = 0 \Rightarrow Q_1^m = 35,\; P_1^m = 65.
$$

$$
\pi_1^m = (65 - 30)\times 35 = 1{,}225.
$$

**Monopoly WTP:**

$$
\Delta\pi^m = \pi_1^m - \pi_0^m = 1{,}225 - 400 = \mathbf{825}.
$$

#### Competitive WTP

Since the innovation is non-drastic, the competitive innovator limit-prices at $p = c_0 = 60$ after acquiring the patent:

$$
Q = 100 - 60 = 40, \qquad \text{profit} = (c_0 - c_1)\times Q = 30\times 40 = \mathbf{1{,}200}.
$$

### (c) Social planner's value and the replacement effect

$$
W(c_0) = \frac{(100 - 60)^2}{2} = \frac{1{,}600}{2} = 800, \qquad
W(c_1) = \frac{(100 - 30)^2}{2} = \frac{4{,}900}{2} = 2{,}450.
$$

$$
\Delta W = 2{,}450 - 800 = \mathbf{1{,}650}.
$$

**Increasing order:**

$$
\underbrace{825}_{\Delta\pi^m} \;<\; \underbrace{1{,}200}_{\text{competitive WTP}} \;<\; \underbrace{1{,}650}_{\Delta W}.
$$

*(Check: with linear demand, $\Delta W = 2\,\Delta\pi^m$ always holds — the planner values the output expansion that the monopolist ignores.)*

**Replacement effect:** The monopolist already earns $\pi_0^m = 400$ before innovating; innovation only adds 825 to its profit rather than yielding the full post-innovation profit of 1,225. The competitive innovator earns zero before the patent, so its incremental gain (1,200) is larger. This is Arrow's replacement effect: pre-innovation rents reduce the incumbent's marginal gain from innovation.

**Why $\Delta W > $ competitive WTP:** The social planner also values the consumer surplus gains from the output expansion ($Q$ rises from 40 to 70 under efficient pricing at $c_1$), which no private firm captures. Neither private incentive approaches the social value of the innovation.
