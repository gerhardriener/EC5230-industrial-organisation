## Problem: Patent length and the ideas model

A patent regulator is evaluating two candidate drugs under the Scotchmer ideas model.
Each drug is characterised by a pair $(\nu, F)$, where $\nu$ is the per-period consumer surplus under competitive supply and $F$ is the fixed development cost.

The regulatory parameters are:

$$
\pi = \tfrac{1}{2}, \qquad \lambda = \tfrac{1}{4}, \qquad r = \tfrac{1}{4},
$$

where $\pi$ is the share of per-period consumer surplus appropriated by the patent holder as profit, $\lambda$ is the per-period deadweight loss as a share of $\nu$, and $r$ is the discount rate. The current (discounted) patent length is $T = 20$.

| Drug | $\nu$ | $F$ |
|------|------:|----:|
| Alpha | 10 | 60 |
| Beta  |  5  | 10 |

### (a) Private investment condition

For each drug, determine whether a firm will voluntarily invest given $T = 20$.

The investment condition is: $\pi \nu T \ge F$.

### (b) Net social value

For each drug, compute the net discounted social value of development:

$$
\text{Social value} = \frac{\nu}{r} - \lambda \nu T - F.
$$

*(Note: with $r = \tfrac{1}{4}$, the perpetual benefit per unit of $\nu$ is $\tfrac{1}{r} = 4$.)*

Does either drug yield a positive net social surplus at $T = 20$?

### (c) Socially optimal patent length for Drug Beta

Find the **minimum patent length** $T^*$ that just induces private investment in Drug Beta.
At $T = T^*$, compute the net social value and state your conclusion.

### (d) Discussion (5 minutes)

At $T = 20$, both drugs are privately profitable yet socially wasteful. Drug Beta becomes socially efficient at a much shorter patent length.

1. What does this imply for the design of a **uniform** patent length (the same $T$ for all drugs)?
2. Why is it difficult in practice to implement **drug-specific** patent lengths, even if they would be welfare-improving?

## Solution

**Parameters:** $\pi = \tfrac{1}{2}$, $\lambda = \tfrac{1}{4}$, $r = \tfrac{1}{4}$ (so $\tfrac{1}{r} = 4$), $T = 20$.

### (a) Private investment condition

**Drug Alpha** ($\nu = 10$, $F = 60$):

$$
\pi\nu T = \tfrac{1}{2}\times 10\times 20 = 100 \ge 60. \qquad \checkmark \quad \text{Invests.}
$$

**Drug Beta** ($\nu = 5$, $F = 10$):

$$
\pi\nu T = \tfrac{1}{2}\times 5\times 20 = 50 \ge 10. \qquad \checkmark \quad \text{Invests.}
$$

Both drugs are privately profitable at $T = 20$.

### (b) Net social value

$$
\text{Social value} = \frac{\nu}{r} - \lambda\nu T - F.
$$

**Drug Alpha:**

$$
\frac{10}{0.25} - \frac{1}{4}\times 10\times 20 - 60 = 40 - 50 - 60 = -70 < 0.
\qquad \text{Socially wasteful.}
$$

**Drug Beta:**

$$
\frac{5}{0.25} - \frac{1}{4}\times 5\times 20 - 10 = 20 - 25 - 10 = -15 < 0.
\qquad \text{Socially wasteful.}
$$

Neither drug yields positive net social surplus at $T = 20$. The discounted deadweight loss during the long patent period ($\lambda\nu T$) exceeds the present value of social benefit ($\nu/r$), net of development cost.

*Intuition:* With $r = 1/4$, the present value of the perpetual benefit stream is only $\nu/r = 4\nu$ — the high discount rate makes future competitive benefits worth little today. Meanwhile, 20 periods of monopoly pricing generate a large deadweight loss.

### (c) Socially optimal patent length for Drug Beta

Set the investment condition to equality and solve for $T^*$:

$$
\pi\nu T^* = F \;\Rightarrow\; \tfrac{1}{2}\times 5\times T^* = 10 \;\Rightarrow\; T^* = 4.
$$

**Social value at $T^* = 4$:**

$$
\frac{5}{\,1/4\,} - \frac{1}{4}\times 5\times 4 - 10 = 20 - 5 - 10 = 5 > 0. \qquad \checkmark
$$

A patent of length $T^* = 4$ is sufficient to induce investment in Drug Beta **and** generates a positive net social surplus of 5.
The current 20-period patent is five times longer than necessary: the excess deadweight loss from periods 5–20 is a pure social waste — Drug Beta would have been developed anyway.

### (d) Discussion

**Uniform patent length:** A single $T$ must simultaneously incentivise high-cost drugs (large $F$, need long protection) and avoid over-rewarding low-cost drugs (small $F$, short protection suffices). With heterogeneous $(\nu, F)$ pairs, no uniform $T$ can be first-best: it will either leave high-$F$ drugs underdeveloped or generate excessive deadweight loss for low-$F$ drugs.

**Drug-specific patent lengths:** A regulator would need to observe each drug's $(\nu, F)$, which are private information held by the firm. Firms have strong incentives to overstate $F$ to obtain longer protection. Solving this requires screening mechanisms or revelation procedures that are administratively complex and litigation-prone. In practice, partial adjustments are made through supplementary protection certificates, compulsory licensing provisions, and tiered examination standards — but a clean drug-by-drug $T^*$ remains infeasible.
