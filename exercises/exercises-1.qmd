## Problem 1: Welfare analysis

Consider the example exercise in Lecture 1, where  

$P = 20 - Q$  

and there are three firms with cost function $c_i(q_i) = c_i q_i$ with  

$c_1 = 0$, $c_2 = 5$, and $c_3 = 7$.

### (a)

Compute the Nash equilibrium of the Cournot duopoly game between firm 1 and firm 2.

### (b)

Given your answer to (a), compute the equilibrium profits, consumer surplus, and welfare loss.

### (c)

Compare the values in (b) to those of the other three market structures (“perfect competition”, “monopoly”, Cournot triopoly) in Lecture 1. Discuss any policy implications for a social planner who maximises total welfare.

# Solution

## (a)

The best response functions are

$$
q_1 = \frac{20 - q_2}{2}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
q_2 = \frac{15 - q_1}{2}.
$$

Solving this system yields the equilibrium quantities

$$
q_1^D = \frac{25}{3},
\qquad
q_2^D = \frac{10}{3}.
$$

## (b)

The equilibrium price is

$$
P(Q^D) = 20 - \frac{35}{3} = \frac{25}{3}.
$$

Consumer surplus is therefore

$$
CS^D = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{35}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{1225}{18},
$$

and producer surplus is

$$
PS^D = \Pi_1 + \Pi_2
= \left( \frac{25}{3} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{10}{3} \right)^2
= \frac{725}{9}.
$$

The welfare loss is

$$
WL^D = 200 - \frac{1225}{18} - \frac{725}{9}
= \frac{925}{18}.
$$

## (c)

Similar to the Cournot triopoly, the Cournot duopoly maximises neither consumer surplus nor producer surplus.

The values for all three welfare components are between those of monopoly and Cournot triopoly:

$$
CS^M < CS^D < CS^T,
\qquad
PS^M > PS^D > PS^T,
\qquad
WL^M < WL^D < WL^T.
$$

As the number of producing firms increases (monopoly $\to$ Cournot duopoly $\to$ Cournot triopoly), prices fall, consumer surplus increases, producer surplus decreases, and the deadweight loss triangle becomes smaller.

However, total welfare $(CS + PS)$ decreases because welfare loss increases. This reflects a growing inefficiency in the allocation of output across firms: a larger share of production is carried out by less efficient firms.

## Problem 2: Linear Hotelling model with monopoly

Consider the Hotelling linear-city model. Suppose there is only one restaurant, located at the centre of a street of length 1 km. The restaurant’s cost is zero.

Consumers are uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$, with one consumer at each point. Transportation cost is £1 per kilometre.

The utility of a consumer located at distance $a$ from the restaurant is

$$
U = B - a - p,
$$

where $p$ is the price of a meal and $B$ is a constant.  

If the consumer does not eat at the restaurant, utility is

$$
U^* = 0.
$$

### (a)

Suppose $0 < B < 1$. Find the number of consumers eating at the restaurant. Calculate the monopoly price and profit.

### (b)

Answer the previous question assuming $B > 1$.

::: {.solution}


# Solution

## (a)

Let $d_m$ denote the distance of the marginal consumer from the restaurant. This consumer is indifferent between eating and not eating:

$$
U = U^*
\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
B - d_m - p = 0,
$$

which implies

$$
d_m = B - p.
$$

Total demand is therefore

$$
q = 2 d_m = 2(B - p).
$$

As a monopolist, the restaurant solves

$$
\max_p \ \Pi(p) = p \cdot 2(B - p) = 2(Bp - p^2).
$$

The first-order condition is

$$
2(B - 2p) = 0
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
p^M = \frac{B}{2}.
$$

Demand is

$$
q^M = 2\left(B - \frac{B}{2}\right) = B,
$$

and profit is

$$
\Pi^M = \frac{B}{2} \cdot B = \frac{B^2}{2}.
$$

## (b)

The solution in part (a) assumes $d_m = B - p < \tfrac{1}{2}$, i.e. that both marginal consumers are located inside the interval $[0,1]$.

At the price $p^M=\frac{B}{2}$, the implied marginal consumers are at distance $d_m=\frac{B}{2}$ from the restaurant.

For $B>1$, we have $d_m>\tfrac{1}{2}$, so demand is capped at $q=1$.

Thus, the restaurant sets the price such that the marginal consumers are exactly at the two ends of the interval. Indifference at distance $\tfrac{1}{2}$ gives

$$
B - \frac{1}{2} - p = 0
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
p^* = B - \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Since $q^* = 1$, profit is

$$
\Pi^* = B - \frac{1}{2}.
$$
