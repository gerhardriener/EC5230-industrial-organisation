## Problem 1: Welfare analysis

Consider the example exercise in Lecture 1, where

$P = 20 - Q$

and there are three firms with cost function $c_i(q_i) = c_i q_i$ with

$c_1 = 0$, $c_2 = 5$, and $c_3 = 7$.

### (a)

Compute the Nash equilibrium of the Cournot duopoly game between firm 1 and firm 2.

### (b)

Given your answer to (a), compute the equilibrium profits, consumer surplus, and welfare loss.

### (c)

Compare the values in (b) to those of the other three market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, Cournot triopoly) in Lecture 1. Discuss any policy implications for a social planner who maximises total welfare.



## Solution

### (a)

The best response functions are

$$
q_1 = \frac{20 - q_2}{2}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
q_2 = \frac{15 - q_1}{2}.
$$

Solving this system yields the equilibrium quantities

$$
q_1^D = \frac{25}{3},
\qquad
q_2^D = \frac{10}{3}.
$$

### (b)

The equilibrium price is

$$
P(Q^D) = 20 - \frac{35}{3} = \frac{25}{3}.
$$

Consumer surplus is therefore

$$
CS^D = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{35}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1225}{18},
$$

and producer surplus is

$$
PS^D = \Pi_1 + \Pi_2
= \left(\frac{25}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2
= \frac{725}{9}.
$$

The welfare loss is

$$
WL^D = 200 - \frac{1225}{18} - \frac{725}{9}
= \frac{925}{18}.
$$

### (c)

The values for all three welfare components fall between those of monopoly and Cournot triopoly:

$$
CS^M < CS^D < CS^T,
\qquad
PS^M > PS^D > PS^T,
\qquad
WL^M < WL^D < WL^T.
$$

As the number of producing firms increases (monopoly $\to$ Cournot duopoly $\to$ Cournot triopoly), prices fall and consumer surplus increases, but production is reallocated toward higher-cost firms (reducing productive efficiency).

## Problem 2: Linear Hotelling model with monopoly

Consider the Hotelling linear-city model. Suppose there is only one restaurant, located at the centre of a street of length 1 km. The restaurant’s cost is zero.

Consumers are uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$, with one consumer at each point. Transportation cost is £1 per kilometre.

The utility of a consumer located at distance $a$ from the restaurant is

$$
U = B - a - p,
$$

where $p$ is the price of a meal and $B$ is a constant.

If the consumer does not eat at the restaurant, utility is

$$
U^* = 0.
$$

### (a)

Suppose $0 < B < 1$. Find the number of consumers eating at the restaurant. Calculate the monopoly price and profit.

### (b)

Answer the previous question assuming $B > 1$.



## Solution

### (a)

Let $d_m$ denote the distance of the marginal consumer from the restaurant. Indifference implies

$$
B - d_m - p = 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
d_m = B - p.
$$

Demand is

$$
q = 2 d_m = 2(B - p).
$$

The monopolist solves

$$
\max_p \ \Pi(p) = p \cdot 2(B - p).
$$

FOC implies $p^M=\frac{B}{2}$, hence $q^M=B$ and $\Pi^M=\frac{B^2}{2}$.

### (b)

For $B>1$, the unconstrained solution implies $d_m=\frac{B}{2}>\frac{1}{2}$, but demand cannot exceed 1, so $q=1$.

The monopolist sets price so the marginal consumers are exactly at the endpoints ($d=\frac{1}{2}$):

$$
B - \frac{1}{2} - p = 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
p^* = B - \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Then $\Pi^*=p^*\cdot 1 = B - \frac{1}{2}$.
