## Linear Hotelling model with monopoly

Consider the Hotelling linear-city model. There is one restaurant located at the centre of a street of length 1 km (i.e. at 0.5). The restaurant's marginal cost is zero.

Consumers are uniformly distributed on the interval ([0,1]), with one consumer at each point. Transportation cost is £1 per kilometre.

A consumer at distance $a$ from the restaurant obtains utility

$$
U = B - a - p,
$$

where $p$ is the price of a meal and $B$ is a constant.

If the consumer does not eat at the restaurant, utility is
$$
U^* = 0.
$$

### Case (0 < B < 1)

Find the number of consumers eating at the restaurant. Calculate the monopoly price and profit.

* Monopoly price: (p^M =) ##{string}##
* Quantity demanded: (q^M =) ##{string}##
* Monopoly profit: (\Pi^M =) ##{string}##

### Case (B > 1)

Answer the previous question assuming (B > 1).

* Monopoly price: (p^* =) ##{string}##
* Quantity demanded: (q^* =) ##{string}##
* Monopoly profit: (\Pi^* =) ##{string}##
