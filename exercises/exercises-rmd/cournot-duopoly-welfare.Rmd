```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Parameters
a  <- 20
c1 <- 0
c2 <- 5

# Cournot duopoly equilibrium
q1 <- 25/3
q2 <- 10/3
Q  <- q1 + q2
P  <- a - Q

CS <- (1/2) * Q^2
PS <- q1^2 + q2^2
WL <- 200 - CS - PS
````

### Problem 1: Welfare analysis

Consider a market with inverse demand
[
P = 20 - Q,
]
and three firms with cost functions ( c_i(q_i) = c_i q_i ), where
( c_1 = 0 ), ( c_2 = 5 ), and ( c_3 = 7 ).

---

### (a) Cournot duopoly

Compute the Nash equilibrium quantities in the Cournot duopoly between firm 1 and firm 2.

* Firm 1 equilibrium output:
  ( q_1^D = ) ##{num}##

* Firm 2 equilibrium output:
  ( q_2^D = ) ##{num}##

---

### (b) Welfare components

Given your answer in (a), compute:

* Equilibrium price:
  ( P^D = ) ##{num}##

* Consumer surplus:
  ( CS^D = ) ##{num}##

* Producer surplus:
  ( PS^D = ) ##{num}##

* Welfare loss:
  ( WL^D = ) ##{num}##

---

### (c) Comparison and policy intuition

Compare consumer surplus, producer surplus, and welfare loss to those under monopoly and Cournot triopoly.

Briefly describe where the duopoly outcomes lie relative to monopoly and triopoly:

## How this maps to your original exercise

### (a)
- Two **numeric cloze fields**
- Exact fractions allowed (R/exams handles rational numbers cleanly)

### (b)
- Four **numeric cloze fields**
- No tolerance issues (exact values)

### (c)
- **String answer**, suitable for:
  - ungraded feedback
  - or light grading (e.g. accept `"between monopoly and triopoly"`, `"intermediate"`, regex, etc.)

If you want (c) **ungraded**, you can set:
```yaml
expoints: 5
````

and keep the string field informational.
